    "summary": "After doing the world a whole lot of good by going after ISIS members, Anonymous activists have now turned their hacking skills towards two websites connected with the UN Climate Change Summit that's going on in Paris this week.  The reason behind the group's actions is a protest that turned ugly over the weekend, where peaceful activists against world climate change policies have been arrested and brutalized by French police forces.  While in normal circumstances peaceful protests would be allowed in any city around the world, France has banned any public gatherings (including protests) after the November 13, Paris ISIS attacks. For this reason, Paris police forces intervened against the protesters, using force, in some cases.  After the incident was consumed, hackers that have identified themselves as part of Anonymous, have targeted the main website of the UN Climate Change Summit, the very same event the peaceful demonstrators were trying to disrupt.  Hackers breached websites, stole and dumped databases online  According to data dumped on the Cyber Guerilla anonymous-posting blog and its adjacent IRC channel, hackers have identified an SQL injection flaw in the summit's website at unfccc.int.  They exploited this vulnerability to extract a database dump and then gain access to the website's CMS administration panel (screenshots below the article). Dump data is available in three Just Paste URLs (1, 2, 3). This attack happened yesterday, November 29.  Today, the same group also hacked meta-fusion.com, the website of the company that provides webcast streaming services for the UN Climate Change Summit (screenshots below the article). As before, an SQL injection seems to be the cause of this intrusion (data dumps 1, 2, 3).  Leaked data contains information like usernames, passwords (most are encrypted), real names, email addresses, organizations, job titles, and security questions.  Anonymous has not expressed any kind of opinion against or for the UN Climate Change Summit, and this attack seems to be only retaliation against what they've perceived as unjustified police brutality.",

Jeffrey Paul Delisle, pleaded guilty last month to passing classified information to Russia.  CBC News reported, \u201cthat electronic records detailing the planned overhaul of Canadian naval intelligence \u2014 created when admitted Russian spy Jeffrey Delisle was at the height of his treachery \u2014 were deleted from a National Defence database.  But when the news agency asked why both the electronic and paper copies had been expunged, and whether that violated access-to-information law, the Navy eventually reversed itself and claimed some copies of the presentations had survived in email accounts of officers serving overseas.\u201d",

These reports pertained to 438 patients and were intended for the American Board of Surgeons to maintain the provider's board certification. Unfortunately, the package containing the medical information never arrived at his home and the United States Postal Service was unable to locate the package. The data elements involved in the documents include patient names, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, diagnoses, descriptions and summaries of select procedures and operations performed by the provider between October 2007 and September 2011. Upon discovery, the 374 MDG immediately initiated an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the loss and identify those who were potentially impacted. To mitigate this incident and prevent future compromises of this nature, the 374 MDG is currently reviewing their policies and procedures to assist providers with the board certification process. ",

    "summary": "Militants May Have Accessed Government Computers At Refuge  by John Sepulvado OPB | Jan. 8, 2016 6:30 p.m. | Updated: Jan. 9, 2016 11:32 a.m. Ryan Bundy, one of the leaders of the armed militants who have taken over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, says his group has not accessed government computers on the site.  Ryan Bundy, one of the leaders of the armed militants who have taken over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, says his group has not accessed government computers on the site.  OPB The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether militants at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge have accessed government computers during their occupation.  OPB observed militants interacting with computers in the compound that can only be accessed with employee ID badges. The armed men also appear to have gone through materials in an office building used by federal employees.  This comes as militants rejected leaving the facility Friday, which they've occupied illegally since Jan. 2.  The computers are in a room of cubicles near the main compound. LaVoy Finicum, a member of the occupying group's security team, accidentally led OPB into the area.  Inside The Occupied Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Building  On Jan. 2, a group of protesters in town supporting the Hammonds _ father and son ranchers convicted of arson who are now imprisoned _ broke into the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge building and began occupying the space. OPB reporter Amanda Peacher has been inside federal buildings taken over by Ammon Bundy and about two-dozen self-styled militiamen. Use the interactive map to better understand how the group is using the buildings within the wildlife refuge.   Map data: Leaflet | Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, swisstopo, and the GIS User Community/OPB   Finicum says the group plans to turn the office into a media center that would eventually house reporters.  There are four desks in the office, two on each side. Three of the computers were turned on, and in screen saver mode. Papers in the room were strewn about in a disorderly manner.  After Finicum realized he shouldn't have allowed OPB to access the room, he quickly picked up lists of names and Social Security numbers by the computers, and hid government employee ID cards that were previously in plain sight.  Shortly after, one of the militant leaders, Ryan Bundy, walked into the room.  When asked about the computers, Bundy emphatically denied any of the work spaces had been touched since the occupation.    \"No, we haven't touched a single personal item. We haven't touched any of the computers, we haven't tried to log on _ we haven't done anything. We're not here to hurt people,\" Bundy said, \"not even the people who work here.\"  The unidentified militant seen here drove the federally-owned vehicle on the right while at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. He left the area after being photographed.  The unidentified militant seen here drove the federally-owned vehicle on the right while at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. He left the area after being photographed.  John Sepulvado/OPB Along with possibly accessing the computers, militants at the compound are using government vehicles and equipment to operate and fortify defenses.  When reached Friday, FBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele declined to officially comment on any activity ongoing at the refuge.  However, law enforcement officials are concerned refuge employees could potentially be harmed by members of the group. Prior to the occupation, federal employees and family members of local law enforcement had received anonymous threats.  Harney County Sheriff David Ward said at a community meeting Wednesday that his deputies and own family members had been followed home, photographed, and had personal property damaged in recent months.  In an interview Friday, Ward said he was concerned about the welfare of the employees who work at the refuge. However, he said he hasn't confirmed militants have indeed accessed any personnel data.    \"With what information we do have, we're doing everything we can to make sure we keep our citizens and those employees safe,\" Ward said.  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Jason Holm also declined to confirm whether the computers had been used. But he did say the agency has taken a full inventory of what was left inside the refuge before the militants seized it.  \"We are cognizant that the individuals in the refuge would have access to files, and things like refuge equipment,\" Holm said. \"We're working with the FBI to mitigate any risk (to employees).\"  There are 16 full-time and one part-time employee who work at the refuge, according to Holm.  \"We are taking all appropriate security precautions,\" Holm said when asked about employee safety.  Reporters Ryan Haas and Conrad Wilson contributed to this report.",

The veteran lives alone and ensures the information is secured and not accessible to anyone. Veteran A indicated the package was \"opened\" as if the mail was not sealed appropriately.

The Albany facility mailed a paper employee health record to a VA facility in Ohio in error. A member of the Ohio facility HR staff telephoned the employee whose\nrecord they received and made the decision to mail the paper record directly back to the employee. The employee in question works for a VA Program Office out of Albany and that was the reason the record was at the Albany facility. When the paper record was received by the employee, she found that there were documents filed in the record pertaining to her husband (same last name)who is an employee of the VAMC in Albany (including SSN). She brought the paper record in to report the incident, but would not relinquish the record. The PO and ISO are dealing with that issue and investigating to determine if the proper procedure was followed and if changes need made based on this incident.",

The two missing laptops were password protected but not encrypted due to being attached to biomedical devices. The laptops were located on mobile test stations in the Pulmonary Department. The portable test equipment was used when patients could not be transported to the Pulmonary Department for testing. The exact number of patients is unknown. The upper limit is 5,000 and could be as low as 350. The ticket will be updated when more information is available.  Update: The laptops were not encrypted as they were attached to biomedical devices. The laptops were VA issued equipment (EE#56243 and EE#56244). The Pulmonary supervisor reported that she discovered the laptops missing on 05/20/14 but was informed by one of the technicians that she saw them missing about 2 weeks ago, exact date unknown, but thought they were being worked on. The supervisor then checked with Information Resource Management Systems (IRMS) and Bio-med to see if they had been picked up the reply was negative. The laptops were last inventoried on 04/22/14 in room 6A-144. These were standalone systems and had never been connected to the network. To the best of the facility's knowledge, the laptops were not secured with cables and it is currently unknown why they were not secured. The facility is currently working on identifying the number of affected individuals (the number could be between 350 - 5000), as well as identifying the identity of the potentially affected individuals.",

Some of these documents have names, full SSNs and dates of birth. Others have names and last four of SSN or names and address. The VA Police notified OIG who declined the case. There are no cameras that view the area where the shred bin was.

The 130 will be offered credit protection services and the 13 will be sent letters of notification.\n04/25/12:\nOn further investigation, the bin was actually a recycle bin, not a shred bin.

The patient allegedly reports that the VA employee accessed her medical record to obtain her personal phone number. The VA employee's supervisor and Administrative Officer of that facility met with the patient to discuss the issue and the patient was offered the opportunity to file a formal complaint. There is currently an ongoing VA Police investigation of the allegation against this employee. The Information Security Officer (ISO) is conducting a sensitive access report (SAR) audit.  Incident Update\n01/19/12:\nThe VISN ISO was not able to perform a SAR as this medical record was not marked \"sensitive\" at the time the incident occurred. Since then, the medical record has been marked \"sensitive\" for future tracking. The VA employee has been placed on Authorized Absence until the investigation is completed by Human Resources (HR) and VA Police.\n02/02/12:\nPer the Chief of Police, the employee admitted to accessing the patient's record while he was not performing his official duties and obtaining her phone number. Therefore the patient will receive a letter offering credit protection services.\nResolution",

    "summary": "A human services worker, fired for identity theft, has been charged with burglary and theft after returning to her former workplace, stealing office equipment and accessing the private information of almost 800 daycare providers, according to the Anoka County Attorneys office.  On the evening of July 9, 2013, 53-year-old Jan Michelle Gray gained access to the fourth floor of the Anoka County Human Services Building in Blaine by telling a custodian that she forgot her badge, according to a criminal complaint.  The next day, several employees noticed that their chairs were adjusted and desk drawers were rifled through. Several items were missing, including a $500 office chair, a network cable, two sweaters, vitamin bottles, a book stand, some cash and small change, an iPod docking station and three-ring binders that used to belong to Gray.  Employees also noticed that several cabinet keys were missing, which could be used to access names, addresses, social security numbers, bank account and routing numbers of 793 daycare providers.  Gray initially denied returning to her former workplace when Blaine Police came to her home in Champlin, but she changed her story after officers told her she was picked out of a photo line-up by the custodian who gave her access.  She admitted going back to the human services building to get a box of her belongings, but claimed she no longer had the box, she didnt steal anything and she was never fired.  Gray is charged with second- and third-degree burglary and one count of theft.  Anoka County Human Services contacted all of the day care providers last summer to alert them of the potential identity theft. ",

    "summary": "Oxford County public health is apologetic after sensitive information was stolen from a car belonging to a health inspector working on call earlier this month.  An on-call bag containing a book of handwritten notes dating back about two years was stolen during a vehicle break-in in London on Sept. 16.  The health inspector did not realize the bag was taken until about three days later.  Lynn Beath, director of public health and emergency services, said its unknown at this time how much personal information or how many people this breach of privacy may have affected.  Were working quickly and we offer our sincere apology to anyone affected. We are definitely learning from this incident, she said during a phone interview Wednesday afternoon following the release of a statement about the incident.  Were really hoping whoever saw the bag, it was a computer bag, saw nothing of value in it and has thrown it away.  Beath explained the handwritten notes in the stolen book pertained to a variety of public health-related topics, with the majority of entries not about specific people or cases.  The book is used by on-call inspectors to quickly jot down information while on the phone after hours.  Were required under Health Protection Ontario public health standards to be accessible to the public 24/7, she said.  Calls come in for reasons including water quality issues, animal bites, health hazards, environmental health hazards and infectious diseases, among other topics.  Infectious disease calls, for example, come in if a break out of mumps occurs. A person from a laboratory or a hospital would call and provide limited data so someone could follow up.  In cases where personal health information was written, there could be any range of data to birth date, name, contact information and potential diagnosis, she said.  The bulk of the calls and entries do not relate to personal information.  Public health is now working to backtrack the data to determine the information that might be in the book.  We have notified our partners that this has happened. Its difficult to backtrack, as this book was only used to take brief notes after hours but that might not be in any other paperwork that the original call came in after hours, she said.  Public health immediately changed its policies after the breach. Now staff must turn the book in with all documentation immediately the day following their on-call shift. Staff must also ensure the book is in their possession at all times or in a locked vehicle. At night, the book must be taken inside.  Public health is working with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario to ensure proper steps are taken.  Over recent years Oxford County and public health has developed strict policies for electronic information, including software encryption on all computers that handle health information and restrictions on how laptop computers are transported.  We will continue to work to ensure this situation doesnt happen again, she said.  Information and updates, including how to contact a public health staff member, are available at www.oxfordcounty.ca/health or by calling 211.",

From the beginning of 2011 until April 2012, Zhang accessed the database twice a month from his home computer, downloading the information that then sold to a manager at Shanghai Roadway D&B Marketing Services Co, the Shanghai subsidiary of the US commercial information firm Dun & Bradstreet Corp.

    "summary": "A former lab worker at the Veterans Hospital in Madison used information stolen from VA records, from mail stolen from her neighbors and information purchased on the Internet to obtain credit cards and access other people's checking accounts, according to criminal charges filed this week.  Elizabeth Feng, 23, of Madison, was charged Thursday with 17 counts of identity theft, two counts of misdemeanor theft and two counts of unauthorized opening of mail in the scheme, which began to unravel on May 30 when her boyfriend tried to make a legitimate payment on some parking tickets at the Madison Police Department.  Police have issued a warrant for Feng, who was also a UW-Madison student at the time.  According to a criminal complaint filed Thursday, the boyfriend went to pay parking tickets after his car had been impounded, only to be told that he had to pay in cash because fraudulent payments had been made for tickets on his car in the past.  Police staff had found that the earlier citations were paid using the checking account information of people who lived in New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut and Mississippi, and that one of those people had contacted police about the fraud, the complaint states.  The man told police the earlier payments had been made by his girlfriend, Feng, the complaint states.  According to the complaint:   Contacted by police, Feng at first admitted to using a \"random person's account\" a couple of times, from information she found on a website. But pressed further, she admitted taking mail belonging to other people in her apartment building in the 400 block of West Dayton Street, not cashing personal checks sent to her neighbors but using account number and bank routing information on them to pay her boyfriend's parking tickets online.  Among the items taken from Feng's neighbors' mail were also packages of goods such as a wine opener, clothing and a cutting board and knife. Feng said she threw most of that stuff away. In her apartment, police found opened mail and boxes addressed to other people. Feng opened six credit card accounts using information for five patients stolen from the VA Hospital, where she worked. She had mail for the accounts addressed to the apartment of one of her neighbors, who told police he was shocked when informed that there were 16 credit cards in 14 names associated with his address. The man said that when he received mail that wasn't addressed to him, he would drop it on the floor by the mailboxes.  Police also found a large number of Capital One credit cards in Feng's apartment and found the names on them matched a list of 15 names and Social Security numbers that police found on a document located on Feng's computer.  Two of VA Hospital patients had since died. The son of one of those men told police that on the day of his father's funeral, his mother received a phone call from Capital One asking if his father had recently opened a credit card with them.  Feng had worked as a medical assistant in the hospital's pathology and lab department. She left her job on May 31. The hospital's lab manager told police that Feng would have had access to patient information including birth dates and Social Security numbers.",

    "summary": "The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange has another problem on their hands after hundreds of Medicaid enrollment packages were mistakenly mailed to the wrong addresses.  The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene explained they were first alerted to the problem on Friday. A customer called an enrollment broker saying they had received the wrong Medicaid packet.  The enrollment packets include the customer's name, date of birth, and Medicaid identification number, according to state health officials.  An investigation has revealed the mailing error affected nearly 400 households and 1,078 people.  While the state contends the people affected make up less than 1 percent of Marylanders enrolled in the program at the beginning of the year, they are putting the blame on Noridian.  Noridian is the prime contractor for the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. The state said the company experienced a programming error leaking the personal information.  The information wrongly mailed to hundreds of addresses did not include social security numbers, financial information, or medical information, explained the health department in a release emailed on Sunday.  The state is also clear that there was no security breach by an outside entity.  Enrollment packages have stopped being mailed and staff has been working all weekend to fix the problem.  The state plans on notifying ever customer affected by the programming error and send the correct packages sometime this week.  Anyone who received Medicaid enrollment packages with wrong information is asked to call the customer service center at 1-855-642-8572.",

Spokeswoman Laura Hart says the problem happened Dec. 24 when some of the 700 callers that day may have inadvertently been able to hear parts of other callers' conversations. It's possible personal information could have been disclosed, including Social Security numbers.  The department is investigating what happened. Hart says it shut down the phone system as soon as officials learned of the problem.  The department is alerting all callers from that day and offering them free credit monitoring services for three months.  Hart says it's believed the number of people affected is much less than the 700 who called that day. ",

The information is not sensitive, but the hackers have told Vice that it\u2019s just a small part of what they\u2019re sitting on. More leaks will come, but only after the data is analyzed.  The hacktivists say they\u2019ve had access to FEMA\u2019s systems for quite some time, but they\u2019ve stolen only small amounts of data at a time in order not to trigger intrusion detection systems.  As far as the timing is concerned, Anonymous says \u201can opportunity to settle an old score, an insult unanswered, arose.\u201d  They\u2019re targeting FEMA not just because of the cyber exercise in which it simulated an attack from Anonymous, but also because the organization is \u201can active investor in corrupt intelligence/defense/security contractors.\u201d",

    "summary": "Anonymous Hijacks Federal Website Over Aaron Swartz Suicide  Activists from the hacker collective known as Anonymous assumed control over the homepage of a federal judicial agency this morning.  In a manifesto left on the defaced page, the group demanded reform to the American justice system and what the activists said are threats to the free flow of information.  The lengthy essay largely mirrors previous demands from Anonymous, but this time the group also cited the recent suicide of Reddit co-founder and activist Aaron Swartz as has having \"crossed a line\" for their organization. Swartz was facing up to 35 years in prison on computer fraud charges.  Prosecutors said he had stolen thousands of digital scientific and academic journal articles from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the goal of disseminating them for free.  Read More: Aaron Swartz' Death Fuels MIT Probe, White House Petition to Oust Prosecutor  Anonymous says Swartz was \"killed because he was forced into playing a game he could not win - a twisted and distorted perversion of justice - a game where the only winning move was not to play.\"  \"There must be a return to proportionality of punishment with respect to actual harm caused,\" it reads, also mentioning recent arrests of Anonymous associates by the FBI.  In their statement, the hackers say they targeted the homepage of the Federal Sentencing Commission for \"symbolic\" reasons.  The group claimed that if their demands were not met they would release a trove of embarrassing internal Justice Department documents to media outlets. Anonymous named the files after Supreme Court justices and provided hyperlinks to them from the defaced page.  As of press time the commission's site had been taken offline but an earlier attempt by CNN to follow the files' links yielded dead-ends, mostly offline sites.  The file names use an \".aes256? suffix, denoting a common encryption protocol. The same system was used to encrypt the Wikileaks Afghan war documents before their release.",

    "summary": "Former Pacific Grove police commander accused by attorney in ex-wife's identity theft case Ex-wife's attorney says John Nyunt 'was involved'  By JULIA REYNOLDS  Herald Staff Writer POSTED:   11/25/2013 08:35:14 PM PST0 COMMENTS| UPDATED:   11 MONTHS AGO  RELATED STORIES Jul 15: Wife of former Pacific Grove cop pleads guilty to ID theft, burglary Apr 24: Former Pacific Grove police Cmdr. Nyunt threatened to kill cops, investigators, prosecutors say Mar 3: Former Pacific Grove police commander arrested Dec 7: Amid investigations, ex-Pacific Grove policeman has quiet support Nov 27: Pacific Grove defends actions in Nyunt case Nov 22: Testimony sheds bad light on Pacific Grove police commander In a convoluted case fraught with ever stranger twists, more questions were raised Monday about a possible cover-up of crimes by a Pacific Grove police commander in the identity theft prosecution of his ex-wife.  After a three-day preliminary hearing, Kristin Nyunt, 39, was ordered by Judge Julie Culver to stand trial on 43 counts of theft, forgery, computer fraud and burglary, including downloading personal information of more than 25 potential victims from a law enforcement-sensitive database assigned for police use by her then-husband John Nyunt, a since retired commander in the Pacific Grove Police Department.  John Nyunt has not been charged in the case, although officials say the Monterey County District Attorney's office and the FBI are investigating him.  \"John Nyunt and his family were among her many, many victims,\" said Juliet Peck, Nyunt's attorney. \"He continues to be.\"  Adding to the confusion during court testimony this week and last is the fact that several of the case's victims were colleagues or relatives of John Nyunt, who has been on leave since Kristin's arrest in January. He retired from the force on Saturday.  According to testimony, Nyunt took charge of investigating his family's complaints for Pacific Grove police while his wife was a suspect.  What hasn't come out in court is why the commander chose to investigate cases involving his own family.  Judge Culver said that \"whether or not another person was involved,\" Kristin Nyunt will have to stand trial.  Advertisement    The crimes were \"very involved ... very sophisticated,\" Culver said.  Over multiple sustained objections of prosecutor Steve Somers, Kristin Nyunt's attorney Angela Johnson suggested John Nyunt looked the other way or failed to fully investigate his wife's alleged crimes, even after victims turned to him for help as a commander in the Pacific Grove Police Department.  \"There's not only the possibility that he was involved,\" Johnson said. \"He was involved.\"  There is ample evidence, she said, \"that John Nyunt is part of this ... He took advantage of my client when she was not being treated for her bipolar condition ... He was part of it and he set her up.\"  In one instance, Nyunt's previous wife had contacted him after she discovered charges were made to credit cards in her name.  Seeing that items were ordered but not yet delivered to an empty rental house in Monterey, the victim allegedly asked Nyunt to stake out the house on the delivery date to see who picked up the package  a common police procedure in mail fraud cases.  But according to testimony, Nyunt never endeavored to see who came for the deliveries, nor did he ask his next-in-command to do so.  That subordinate, a Pacific Grove officer who has since left the area to work at another department, later became one of the scam's identity theft victims, according to testimony.  Johnson also suggested John Nyunt committed a security breach when he attended an FBI training in Quantico, Va., and failed to report to law enforcement he'd just discovered Kristin had apparently tapped into his cellphone.  According to testimony, district attorney investigator George Ramirez was the only law enforcement official to learn of the phone bugging, and that was after Ramirez asked John Nyunt about it.  As to whether John Nyunt could have been involved in crimes or cover-ups, prosecutor Somers said, \"He could have ... It doesn't affect her culpability.\"  Somers said the case involved a \"clear modus operandi\" of running database searches for the names of people who somehow crossed Kristin's path. Then phony credit accounts were set up and merchandise ordered.  \"A lot of the stuff ends up in Kristin Nyunt's home,\" he said. Among the items seized by police were several Victoria's Secret bras that were possibly ordered through the scam.  Forged checks were also traced to Kristin after she allegedly tried to cash them at a Carmel area grocery store.  Plenty of evidence tied her to the crimes, Somers said.  Kristin Nyunt is scheduled for arraignment on Dec. 10.  Julia Reynolds can be reached at 648-1187 or jreynolds@montereyherald.com.",

You are sometimes viewed as the reason some defendant is going to jail. It gets personal, sometimes real personal. On September 25, 1995, Paul McLaughlin, a prosecutor in Boston, was murdered by a gang member he was prosecuting. He was killed in the parking lot of a commuter rail station. He was on his way home and the murderer knew which train he took. The murderer probably didnt know where he lived.  Lulz Security's hacking continues to get political: on Friday the group attacked the Arizona Department of Public Safety in retaliation for immigration laws. \"We are releasing hundreds of private intelligence bulletins, training manuals, personal email correspondence, names, phone numbers, addresses and passwords belonging to Arizona law enforcement,\" LulzSec said in a statement. \"We are targeting AZDPS specifically because we are against SB1070 and the racial profiling anti-immigrant police state that is Arizona.\"  ",

    "summary": "The Information Commissioners Office has served a monetary penalty of 100,000 on Kent Police after confidential information, including copies of police interview tapes, was left in the basement of a former police station.  The highly sensitive information included records relating back to the 1980s, thought to have been left at the site when the building was vacated in July 2009.  The information was discovered when a police officer was visiting a business owner about an unrelated matter on 27 November 2012 and noticed a pile of tapes with the logo of Kent Police stuck on them. The business owner confirmed that he had found the tapes in the basement of the old police station, after purchasing the site two months before, and was planning on watching them for entertainment.  The police service visited the site of the old station the next day and recovered hundreds of additional documents and evidence tapes. These included recorded interviews with informants, crime victims and individuals who had subsequently been convicted. The documents also included information about police staff.  The ICOs investigation found that Kent Police had no guidance or procedures in place to makes sure personal information was securely removed from former premises. The problem was made worse due to an apparent breakdown in communications between the various departments involved in the move.  ",

According to the federal indictment, Kyles was authorized to use the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles' Driver and Vehicle Information Database while assisting local residents with traffic tickets and driver-related criminal cases.  But Kyles' frequent use of the database triggered a red flag which led to the discovery that she was stealing motorists' identities. Court records did not specify how many identities were stolen, but U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenbaum said Monday that there were at least 10 victims and the loss was between $120,000 and $200,000.",

    "summary": "What happened?  On Monday the 15th of October the Ministry of Social Development received a USB containing 7,307 items downloaded from two kiosks.  A team led by the Ministry\u2019s Chief Legal Advisor then put in an intensive effort to analyse these items and categorise them based on the amount of personal information contained in them, and the sensitivity of that information. What did this team find?  Information on the USB related to corporate data. Most were invoices with no client details. However, as outlined above around 1,432 items did contain some personal information.  Of all these items, invoices relating to10 individuals contained highly sensitive information. Was there a privacy breach?  Yes, in the sense that two individuals accessed people\u2019s information that was of a personal nature.  In the majority of cases, we have assessed the impact of the breach to be low as Keith Ng and Ira Bailey have assured us that the information was not further distributed and they have not retained copies.  In the cases of the eight children and two adults whose invoices contained highly sensitive information \u2013 we will be working on how best to respond to these individuals. This approach is in accordance with the Privacy Commissioner\u2019s guidelines.",

    "summary": "News release: 17 December 2012 There is an underlying problem with data protection in local government  Information Commissioner  The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) has criticised local governments attitude towards protecting personal data, after four local councils were issued civil monetary penalties.  Leeds City Council was served a monetary penalty of 95,000, Plymouth City Council 60,000 and Devon County Council 90,000 after separate incidents saw details of child care cases sent to the wrong recipients, while the London Borough of Lewisham was issued a penalty of 70,000 after social work papers were left on a train.  The penalties mean that nineteen local councils have now received monetary penalties for breaching the Data Protection Act, totalling 1,885,000.  Leeds City Council The case in Leeds saw sensitive personal details about a child in care sent to the wrong person, revealing details of a criminal offence, school attendance and information about the childs relationship with their mother.  When sending internal mail, the council re-use envelopes that have been used for external mail. But in this case the external address wasnt crossed out, and so the sensitive file was posted to someone who had nothing to do with this case.  More details can be found in the final penalty notice.  Plymouth City Council  The breach at Plymouth City Council followed a similar pattern, with information passed to the wrong recipient including highly sensitive personal information about two parents and four children, notably allegations of child neglect relating to ongoing care proceedings.  The breach occurred when two reports about separate child neglect cases were sent to the same shared printer. Three pages from the first report were mistakenly collected with the papers from the second case, and so were handed to the wrong family.  More details can be found in the final penalty notice.  Devon County Council In Devon, a social worker used a previous case as a template for an adoption panel report they were writing, but a copy of the old report was sent out instead of the new one.  The mistake revealed personal data of 22 people, including details of alleged criminal offences and mental and physical health.  More details can be found in the final penalty notice.  London Borough of Lewisham In Lewisham, a social worker left sensitive documents in a plastic shopping bag on a train, after taking them home to work on.  The files, which were later recovered from the rail companys lost property office, included GP and police reports and allegations of sexual abuse and neglect.  More details can be found in the final penalty notice.  Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said:  We are fast approaching two million pounds worth of monetary penalties issued to UK councils for breaching the Data Protection Act, with nineteen councils failing to have the most straightforward of procedures in place  It would be far too easy to consider these breaches as simple human error. The reality is that they are caused by councils treating sensitive personal data in the same routine way they would deal with more general correspondence. Far too often in these cases, the councils do not appear to have acknowledged that the data they are handling is about real people, and often the more vulnerable members of society.  The distress that these incidents would have caused to the people involved is obvious. The penalties we have issued will be of little solace to them, but we do hope it will stop other people having to endure similar distress by sending out a clear message that this type of approach to personal data will not be tolerated.  There is clearly an underlying problem with data protection in local government and we will be meeting with stakeholders from across the sector to discuss how we can support them in addressing these problems.  The ICO is pressing the Ministry of Justice for stronger powers to audit local councils data protection compliance, if necessary without consent.  The same powers are sought for NHS bodies across the UK following a series of data protection breaches in the health sector.  You can see details of the councils who have been issued with civil monetary penalties at: http://www.ico.gov.uk/enforcement/fines.aspx. All monetary penalties are paid into the Treasurys Consolidated Fund and are not kept by the Commissioner.  -----  ",

No Social Security numbers were accessed, no financial information and no medical information.\"  Williams said information taken centers around state employees who took part in wellness screenings in 2013.  Someone got into the computer systems of Onsite Health Diagnostics, a third-party vendor used by the state. Email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, genders and dates of birth were all reportedly stolen.  \"It was a data table with some certain information for our members who are involved in wellness screenings as part of the health plan,\" Williams said.  The hackers got information on more than 60,000 state employees.  Onsite Health Diagnostics said the data was taken between January and April of this year. Once made aware, Williams said the company launched an investigation.  \"It was an old computer system,\" Williams said. \"They have a new computer system in place with new securities.\"  Onsite Health Diagnostics is offering free identity theft protection for those affected. So far, authorities are not aware of any identity theft related to this data breach.

    "summary": "Illinois insurance officials mistakenly allowed the Social Security numbers of an unknown number of health care providers to be posted publicly.  The Illinois Department of Insurance disclosed the privacy breach Friday in a news release. Department officials learned of it Monday after receiving a complaint. It's unclear how long the Social Security numbers were viewable.  The numbers were included in filings from Blue Cross Blue Shield, which Illinois provided to a website operated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The national association said Friday it's not aware of any previous disclosure of sensitive data occurring on its filings website.  State officials say they took immediate action to remove the information from the website. They are notifying the health care providers involved and reviewing state procedures to prevent similar breaches.  - See more at: http://wtax.com/news/101101-illinois-department-of-insurance-discloses-privacy-breach/#sthash.Z69fgZzZ.dpuf",

The state elections and technology departments agreed that the systems were vulnerable, but they told the Office of the Auditor General they are not aware of any time information in the Digital Driver's License System and the Qualified Voter File was compromised.  State auditors said the departments of state and information technology did not ensure that an outside contractor effectively secured the Digital Driver's License System, which may lead to identity theft. The system included information from about 7.2 million driver's licenses and 1 million personal identification cards in January 2004.",

    "summary": "Update: After this entry was posted, PHIprivacy.net received additional information indicating that there were actually two Macomb County Business Associates involved in the provision of the file to the County. One of these two Business Associates is U.S. Health Holdings subsidiary Automated Benefit Services,  a spokesperson for the countys communications firm tells PHIprivacy.net. The breach did not occur at or by Automated Benefit Services, but the breach was reported to HHS by U.S. Health Holdings Ltd on behalf of Covered Entity Macomb County. The other Business Associate is not a U.S. Health Holdings Ltd. subsidiary or client of ours, the spokesperson writes.  A new entry on HHSs public breach tool involves an incident reported by U.S. Health Holdings, Ltd. on behalf of Macomb County, Michigan. The breach is coded on the tool as involving Unauthorized Access/Disclosure.  On October 1, Macomb County issued a press release about the incident that was sent to various news outlets serving Macomb County, Michigan: the Macomb County Daily, the Detroit News, and the Detroit Free Press. It was also issued to NBC affiliate WDIV. A copy of the release was sent to PHIprivacy.net by the countys communications firm, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP:  Although there is no indication of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information or protected health information belonging to participants in the Macomb County Medical, Dental, and Vision Plans (the Plans), Macomb County, Michigan (the County) will be notifying employees, as well as their dependents and spouses, who have the potential to be affected by the inadvertent posting of certain information on the Michigan Inter- Governmental Trade Network (MITN) website.  The inadvertent posting occurred in conjunction with the County soliciting bids from potential Plan service vendors. As part of the competitive bid process, the County received a file inadvertently containing personal information from one of its vendors. The file was then posted to the registered user-only restricted access portion of MITN from July 3, 2014 to July 31, 2014 so that potential bidders were able to review the information and submit bids to the County. Thereafter and until the situation was discovered on September 10, 2014, the information was accessible to MITN users by way of a link from the MITN homepage. The file posted to MITN contained participant names, dates of birth, social security numbers, zip codes, cities, and Plan carrier names. This file did not include any treatment, diagnosis or treating physician information, or Plan identification numbers. Once discovered, the information was immediately removed from MITN. A thorough investigation into this matter has been performed and changes have been made to the Countys competitive bidding process to prevent this from occurring again in the future.  On September 30, 2014, letters were mailed to those participants identified as being potentially affected by the incident, and to the parents/guardians of participants potentially affected dependents. Notice of this incident was also provided to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to the national consumer reporting agencies on October 1, 2014.  Although there is no report of any attempted or actual misuse of participant information, those identified as being potentially affected are also receiving access to one year of free identity and credit monitoring and restoration services, along with access to a confidential assistance line and to an identity theft protection specialist.  To further protect against identity theft or other financial loss, individuals are encouraged to remain vigilant, review account statements and monitor credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, individuals are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the national consumer reporting agencies. Free credit reports can be ordered at www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling 1-877-322-8228. The national consumer reporting agencies can also be contacted directly to request a free credit report.  Individuals are also encouraged to review Explanation of Benefits statements received from insurers for suspicious activity. If an individual does not receive regular Explanation of Benefits statements, he or she can contact his or her insurer to request copies. Individuals may want to order copies of credit reports to check for any unrecognized medical bills. If an individual finds anything suspicious, he or she may call the credit reporting agency at the phone number on the report.  At no charge, an individual can have the national consumer reporting agencies place a fraud alert on the individuals file that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify the individuals identity prior to granting credit in the individuals name. As soon as one national consumer reporting agency confirms the fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on the individuals file. Because a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect the individual against identity theft or fraud, it may also delay the individuals ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies the individuals identity. The contact information for the national consumer reporting agencies is: Equifax P.O. Box 105069, Atlanta, GA 30348-5069, 800-525-6285, www.equifax.com; Experian P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, 888-397-3742, www.experian.com; TransUnion P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022, 800-680-7289, www.transunion.com.  Individuals can also further educate themselves regarding identity theft, and the steps that can be taken to protect themselves, by contacting their state Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. The Federal Trade Commission can be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/, 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653- 4261. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should be reported to law enforcement, your Attorney General, and the FTC. Known or suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud should be reported to law enforcement.  Anyone with any additional questions may contact the confidential assistance line, available at 1- 877-313-1395 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., Central Standard Time, Monday through Saturday.  Thats a fairly comprehensive notification and really gives those potentially affected the information and tools they need to protect themselves and their dependents.  According to the notification to HHS, 6,302 employees and dependents were notified of the breach. ",

Federal prosecutors say 43-year-old Joann Rittall pleaded guilty Thursday to identity theft and fraud charges which led to $240,000 in tax refunds to which she was not entitled.  She was released pending sentencing.  Prosecutors say Rittall helped more than 20 people file claims under Maine\u2019s Residents Property Tax and Rent Refund \u2018\u2018Circuit Breaker\u2019\u2019 Program. She then used their personal information to file federal income tax returns claiming refunds in their names.  The Kennebec Journal (http://bit.ly/16TD6y9 ) reports that Rittall directed the refunds to be sent to bank accounts she had opened.  She also agreed to repay almost $220,000 to the U.S. Treasury and almost $20,000 to the state of Maine.",

    "summary": "The Office of Personnel Management is alerting more than 48,000 federal employees their personal information may have been exposed following a breach at KeyPoint Government Solutions, which conducts background investigations of federal employees seeking security clearances.  The total number of employees affected is 48,439, according to an email from OPM Chief Information Officer Donna Seymour obtained by Nextgov.  Seymour said OPM worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the incident, \"and while we found no conclusive evidence that [personally identifiable information] was taken by the intruder, OPM has elected to conduct these notifications out of an abundance of caution.\"  Affected employees will receive free credit monitoring.  DHS spokesman S.Y. Lee on Thursday evening told Nextgov the breach was detected by a DHS entity.   \"Recently, the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center became aware of a potential intrusion of a private sector company that conducts U.S. government security background investigations for OPM,\" he said in a statement. \"Working with OPM and other interagency partners, the NCCIC, per standard procedure, deployed an on-site [U.S.-Computer Emergency Readiness Team] to assess and mitigate any risks identified.\"  \"As we examine the potential impact on DHS employees, we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our workforce and will take all appropriate measures to safeguard it,\" he added.   Background investigators conduct interviews with employees or applicants seeking security clearances, as well as their family members, neighbors and former employers. Investigators also compile police and court records on interview subjects. Their reports are used by federal officials to determine potential employees' suitability to hold security clearances and are a treasure trove of personal information.  An OPM statement provided to Nextgov read in part: \"We take very seriously our responsibility to protect sensitive data in background investigations, and our top priority is to make sure the networks that handle that data are secure. KeyPoint has worked closely with OPM to implement additional security controls that will afford its network greater protection.\"  It's the second time this year hackers have targeted a private background-check company. Over the summer, USIS, once the government's largest provider of checks, revealed its systems had been breached, potentially exposing information on 25,000 employees. OPM subsequently temporarily suspended work with the company in the wake of that breach and later severed ties altogether.   \"Following the discovery of the problem, KeyPoint implemented numerous controls to strengthen the security of its network,\" Seymour's email stated. \"The immediacy with which KeyPoint was able to remediate vulnerabilities has allowed us to continue to conduct business with the company without interruption.\"  A month before the USIS hack, OPM's own networks were breached, with news reports indicating Chinese hackers had infiltrated OPM's databases, potentially in pursuit of the personnel files of security clearance holders.  KeyPoint did not immediately return phone calls and emails seeking comment.   DHS says it inspected other background check firms for vulnerabilities following the USIS breach. ",

In addition to defacing the website  which has been restored , the hacktivists have also leaked 5 gigabytes of documents that allegedly represent the partys financial accounts from 1990 to 2011.  Darknet.in reports that the party refused to release the documents after a judge overseeing a political corruption scandal asked to see them.  The information has been posted on torrent sites, blogs and other websites so that citizens can analyze it.  According to a video statement published by the hackers a couple of days ago, the documents show that the Peoples Party has used public money to buy expensive cars, a pony and other items.  The hacktivists are displeased with the fact that the party keeps talking about austerity and cuts while it robs the people. ",

    "summary": "The Indiana State Medical Association (ISMA) experienced the theft of two archive backup hard drives on Feb. 13, 2015. The equipment stored the ISMA group health and life insurance databases, which contained information on 39,090 insureds. This was a random criminal act that occurred while an ISMA employee was transporting the hard drives to an offsite storage location as part of the association's disaster recovery plan. The theft was reported to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD), which is actively investigating.  The information on the stolen hard drives, which cannot be retrieved without special equipment and technical expertise, included identifying information such as name, address, date of birth, email address, health plan number, social security number and personal medical history information.  The ISMA sent notification letters to the individuals affected, which are current and former insureds of the ISMA insurance plans. Each individual notification letter explains the specific types of information involved, since not all records included social security numbers or medical history information. A copy of the letter sent to our insureds is included with this release.  The ISMA is offering one year of credit-monitoring and repair services to all persons affected at no cost to them. Those individuals can also call toll-free 888-774-3252 with any questions.  Although the ISMA's insurance plans are through Anthem, this situation is separate from the recent cyber attack on Anthem. However, there is likely to be significant overlap between the two groups.",

    "summary": "A laptop computer with donors financial information has been stolen from the Anchorage office of the Byron Mallott gubernatorial campaign.  The laptop was discovered missing about 7 p.m. Wednesday, as volunteers were wrapping up their day.  Campaign advisor Bruce Botelho says the laptop was in a restricted area at the back of the office.  What we believe may have happened was the back door had not latched properly. Someone had come in through the back door while volunteers were working in the front public area of the campaign and it was removed.  Botelho says nothing else was taken.  PDF copies of checks and credit cards were on the computer, including each contributors name, mailing address, phone number, bank account, or credit card and security code numbers, as well as occupation and employer.  A letter went out Thursday to more than a thousand Mallott contributors, recommending they verify and monitor their bank and credit card accounts. State law requires immediate notification of lost or stolen personal information, unless a criminal investigation calls for delay.  Important to this entire incident is the fact that the computer was password protected and was shut down at the time, Botelho says. In that respect that lessens the risk, I think, to any of our donors. But nevertheless, there still is a risk. Botelho believes it was a random theft and not targeted at the Democrats campaign for governor.  Anchorage police are investigating the incident.  ",

They later released a video, right before hacking the church\u2019s website, in which they said:      \u201cWe will not allow you to corrupt the minds of America with your seeds of hatred. We will not allow you to inspire aggression to the social factions which you deem inferior. We will render you obsolete. We will destroy you. We are coming.\u201d  And come they did. Using the Twitter accounts @YourAnonNews, @LulzExecutive, @Shm00pLOL, and others, they posted sensitive information about Westboro Baptist Church members. The information included social security numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and even the family tree (i.e. how the members are connected to each other).",

    "summary": "Self-serve kiosks installed at three Compass Group locations in the US have been compromised, putting at risk payment card information of customers.  Compass Group is a food service management company that serves about 8 million meals on a daily basis, through vending machines installed in places such as restaurants, corporate cafes, schools, arenas or museums. It has over 220,000 associates in all American states and in Canada.  Card security codes exposed  According to an announcement disclosing the compromise, the malware infecting the payment terminal captured card information that included names, card numbers, expiration dates and the CVV (card verification value).  An attacker in possession of this data can make fraudulent online purchases in the name of the victim. As per the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), merchants should not store the CVV code on their systems.  The impacted customers are those that made purchases at one of three on-site dining locations in California (450 American Street, Simi Valley; 1800 Tapo Canyon Road, Simi Valley; and 375 Trimble Road, San Jose) between February 2 and March 9, 2015.  Compass Group says that it has no indication that any point-of-sale terminals at other locations have been compromised by cybercriminals.  One year of free identity protection available  The risk mitigation procedure for the affected payment systems included disabling them and removing the malware from them. The company says that the incident has been contained.  Although there is no information that the data exposed has been exfiltrated by the attackers, the Compass Group recommends the affected customers to review and keep a close eye on the credit report and the bank account statements.  Should suspicious activity be observed, customers are advised to contact the financial institution that issued the card and credit monitoring companies.  Compass Group offers all impacted customers a free subscription for free identity protection for one year. The subscription also covers credit monitoring. ",

A press release from Illinois\u2019 Attorney General Lisa Madigan on Friday alleged that Joseph Woods, 32, was the scheme\u2019s ringleader. Woods paid employees to skim information from credit and debit cards used at restaurants around Greater Chicago. Woods gathered this information and later used it to make counterfeit credit cards which he, and an accomplice, Alex Houston, 22, allegedly used to make illegal purchases with.  Woods\u2019 employees, Britain Woods, 33, Essence Houston, 28, Jenette Farrar, 34, and Kenyetta Davis, 31, all of Chicago, were also arraigned on Friday. The four defendants held jobs at 'The Friendly Confines' of Wrigley Field and Ralph Lauren Restaurant, along with local Taco Bell and McDonald\u2019s restaurants. While working there, the employees swiped cards using a small reader given to them by Woods.  Bank accounts hit by the scheme include those with Chase, U.S. Bank, Citibank, Harris Bank, American Express, Bank of America and Fifth Third Bank. While the press release isn't exactly clear how many individuals were affected by the scam, a report from a local CBS affiliate, citing a statement from Assistant Attorney General Ansh Vaidya, claims a few dozen victims were affected from 2007 to 2011.",

    "summary": "\"It feels really not good and it is a violating feeling to have someone break into your clinic,\" said Gretchen Gantz, HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for Lincoln County Health and Human Services. Her statement follows the break-in of the North Lincoln County Community Health Center Clinic at 4422 N.E. Devils Lake Blvd., in Lincoln City. \"Plus we now have the added expenses of having to replace things that are grant funded. We run on a shoestring budget, so it is hard when you have a hit like that,\" said Gantz. During the evening of April 17, the Clinic and surrounding offices in the same building, were broken into by an unknown person or persons, according to a release from Casey Miller, Lincoln County public information officer. Locked doors, rooms and cabinets were forcibly entered. Money was taken from the clinic, but it appears no other records or materials were removed. No electronic devices were taken or accessed. However, the locked room which contains medical charts for clients was breached. These files contain protected health information and may also contain information such as social security numbers and personal financial information. Lincoln County has identified and notified the clients whose protected health information and personal information was in those files. \"In accordance with law and standard practices in these situations we are notifying clients of this breach of our security because this information potentially could be compromised, \" said Casey. \"The charts have been secured and security at the clinic is being enhanced. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that there was an attempt to obtain or use any protected health or personal information.\" But Casey said there is always some risk in these situations, so Lincoln County is contacting the three major credit reporting agencies about the incident and has given those agencies a general report, alerting them to the fact that the incident occurred. \"There is a potential that protected health information could have been breached,\" said Gantz. \"That's why we are notifying all our clients.\" Letters were sent to about 1,000 North Lincoln County Community Health Clinic clients on June 13. \"We want our clients to make sure their personal financial records are secure,\" said Gantz. \"Just in case. It is due diligence to make sure that our clients are taken care of.\" Gantz said none of the computers, other electronic equipment and medical supplies were disturbed. \"It appears that the suspect or suspects knew how to effectively use a crow bar. We have to replace several desks and several doors that were damaged by the crow bar.\" She said the clinics safe was also broken into and about $170 taken. The News Guard's calls to Lincoln City Police detectives about suspect information have not been returned as of June 18. Gantz said public notification of the break-in was delayed due to the investigation circumstances and the need to first notify clinic clients. Clients were given a recommendation to monitor their financial accounts and promptly contact the financial institution if any unauthorized activity is observed. Clients can also submit an identity theft complaint to the Federal Trade Commission by calling toll free to 1-877-ID THEFT (1-877-438-4338 or online at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/ Clients may also want to contact the three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) to obtain a free credit report from each by calling 1-877-322-8228 or online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Even if suspicious activity is not found on initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that credit reports be checked periodically Consumer protection laws allow people to place a security freeze or a fraud alert on their credit files. By placing a freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires personal identifying information will not be able to use the information to open new accounts or borrow money in another persons name. An alert places a statement in the credit file that notifies anyone requesting a copy of the credit report that the person may be the victim of an ID theft. Generally, if an identity theft complaint is filed with the FTC as outlined above, there may be no charge to place the freeze. If, however, any client involved in this incident is charged and pays a cost from the credit reporting agency associated with this option, they can contact the county at the address below and provide documentation of payment to be reimbursed. Lincoln County will provide additional information concerning identity theft on its website at www.co.lincoln.or.us. Lincoln County takes the role of safeguarding the personal information of clients very seriously and is doing everything it can to prevent this situation in the future.

The hard drives included birthdates, names, diagnoses, types of procedures and other clinical notes. There were no Social Security numbers or addresses on the hard drives.  Because of the number of patients affected, Sentara is required by federal law to notify patients and the news media and to post a notice on the health system's website.  The theft led to new protocols. Portable hard drives are now secured in a locked drawer at all times.",

The compromised data includes names, addresses, dates of birth, marital status, Social Security numbers, Medicaid and Medicare numbers and medical record numbers, as well as some diagnosis and treatment information.  Hartford Hospital discovered the laptop's theft in June. It has been reported to police and is under investigation, according to Jepsen's office.  The employee was working on a quality improvement project related to hospital readmissions. The compromised data include records of 2,097 Hartford Hospital patients and 7,461 patients of VNA Healthcare Inc., a Connecticut home hospice services operator.  San Mateo, Calif.-based Greenplum was acquired by EMC in 2010 and forms the foundation for the Hopkinton, Mass.-based data storage giant's big data division.",

According to the provider of health services, attacker(s) hacked into a server and accessed patient and employee data files from St. Joseph Regional Health Center, Burleson St. Joseph Health Center, Madison St. Joseph Health Center, Grimes St. Joseph Health Center and St. Joseph Rehabilitation Center.  The data accessible to attackers included a combination of names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and possibly addresses, the organization said. For the affected patients, medical information was also accessible, and for some employees, bank account information was exposed.  The attackers appeared to be operating from IP addresses in China and elsewhere, the organization said.  As soon as the incident was discovered, SJHS took the affected server offline and launched a thorough forensics investigation with national security and computer forensics experts, a statement explained. The investigation, which is ongoing, confirmed that approximately 405,000 former and current patients', employees' and some employees' beneficiaries' information was accessible to the unauthorized parties.  While it is possible that some information was taken, the forensics investigation has been unable to confirm this, the statement continued. SJHS does not believe any of our former/current patients', employees' or their beneficiaries' information is at further risk because of this incident.  Affected individuals whose information was accessible are receiving notification letters by mail in the coming days providing them information on this incident.  For individuals who may have been affected by the incident, SJHS said it would provide a confidential call center to handle questions related to the breach, along with free identity protection services for one year for affected patients and employees.",

Silverberg discovered the security breach on August 28, 2015, and immediately launched an investigation. That investigation revealed the device had posted data online since September 10, 2013. The company has now secured the device and data and has enlisted the help of a specialist data security firm to conduct a forensic data analysis to determine whether data was accessed during that time frame.  The matter has also been reported to various law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, and government and state authorities have also been notified of the security breach. Affected individuals have now been notified by mail, and are being offered a year of credit monitoring services, along with identity theft protection and identity restoration services through Kroll.

    "summary": "  Complete Medical Homecare didnt encrypt emails sent to trusted business partners like All American Medical Supplies. That failure to encrypt, combined with human error, resulted in a regrettable privacy breach.  On December 27, CMH discovered that materials with patients names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and certain medical diagnoses had been transmitted to AAMS on December 12. AAMS then used that information, in error, to send introductory letters to the patients and, in some cases, they sent them medical equipment.  When CMH discovered their error, they contacted AAMS, who destroyed their copy of the data, and agreed that no further letters would be sent out. Patients who received equipment from AAMS were asked to contact them to arrange for the return of the equipment at no cost to them.  Because CMH and AAMS are both covered by HIPAA, this breach was not as bad as it might have been, although clearly it was an unintended disclosure of PHI that patients needed to be informed about.  As part of preventing future incidents of this kind, CMH is undertaking a number of steps, including deploying encryption when emailing outside the company. Actually, they should have been doing that anyway, as even though they may trust the recipient, failure to encrypt allows capture or interception of the communications by attackers.  You can read CMHs report to the New Hampshire Attorney Generals Office and their notification to three New Hampshire residents here (pdf).  The total number of patients notified was not reported.  Update: The breach also affected 16 Maryland residents, but we still dont know the total number affected. ",

Its warning comes following four data breaches at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust which saw letters containing sensitive information about the treatment of five patients being sent to the wrong addresses.  The breaches happened between January 2012 and June 2013, with three of the instances caused by temporary staff who despite being involved with the handling of private information, hadn't received proper data protection training. \"This time of year often coincides with a rise in the number of temporary workers being employed across the UK,\" said ICO enforcement group manager, Sally Anne Poole. \"However, the temporary nature of their employment doesn't absolve employers of their legal responsibilities for making sure people's information is being looked after correctly,\" she continued. \"If organisations are employing temporary or agency workers into positions that involve the handling and sending out of personal information then they must make sure these staff have received adequate data protection training,\" Poole said. She added that Great Ormond Street is now required to ensure it improves its data protection standards. \"Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust failed to do this and have now been required to sign an undertaking with our office to improve their practices,\" Poole concluded ",

    "summary": "Stanley Hill was dropping off some personal items at the York County Solid Waste Authority incinerator Memorial Day weekend when he noticed bundles of documents strewn across the ground and filling a nearby dumpster.  The Shrewsbury Township resident stopped to pick one up and found a stack of personal medical records from a local doctor's office.  \"It shocked me,\" he said. \"Who would think it's OK to dump them there?\"  Hill said he had worked for Johns Hopkins University where he spent some time implementing HIPAA regulations in computer software. He immediately felt he had to protect the files.  He wanted to alert the public, so he gathered up records from the ground  47 files  and gave them to the York Daily Record.  \"I wasn't sure what to do at first,\" he said. \"I didn't know if I should take them to the police. I finally thought, this is what news agencies are for.\"  The York Daily Record contacted the Pennsylvania Department of State, which then asked for the files. The Daily Record gave them to an investigator. The department will review the documents as the first step in an investigation, according to Ron Ruman, press secretary with the state.  It is not known who delivered the local medical records found at the authority's dumpster, or how they got there.  The files bear the names of the York Academy of Surgery and Dr. R. Dale McCormick.  They contain personal medical information, doctors' notes, social security numbers and insurance information.  Some of the surgeries occurred at Memorial Hospital, according to the records. But a hospital spokesman said the records did not belong to Memorial.  Jason McSherry, community relations and marketing spokesman at the hospital, said York Academy of Surgery was a private practice.  \"It is normal practice for hospitals to securely share patient records related to care provided by the hospital with independent physicians on the medical staff to support the delivery of care to their patients,\" McSherry said. \"Once records have been provided to physicians, it is their responsibility to dispose of those records in a secure manner.\"  Ruman said McCormick has an active osteopathic medical license.  Calls made to the practice on Eastern Boulevard in Springettsbury Township rang unanswered, and the office appeared vacant. Neighbors said they didn't know the last time they'd seen someone there.  Other attempts to locate the doctor or the practice were unsuccessful.  Rachel Seeger with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which handles HIPAA regulations, said it was the first they had heard of the incident and were unable to comment.  Ruman said he could not recall similar cases. Most of the cases the Department of State deals with involve patients who want access to paperwork after an office has closed.  According to the Health and Human Services website, medical officers \"are not permitted to simply abandon\" patient information or \"dispose of it in dumpsters or other containers that are accessible by the public or other unauthorized persons. However, the Privacy and Security Rules do not require a particular disposal method.\"  Doctors are told to review their own policies and determine what steps are \"reasonable to safeguard\" patients.  The only time they may be dumped in trash receptacles is if the size of the files requires they be put in locked dumpsters accessible only to authorized people, according to the website.  Ruman added that the state requires offices to keep medical records for seven years, and that doctors are responsible for protecting patient information, but that the state does not regulate how the records must be destroyed.  Ellen O'Connor with the York County Solid Waste Authority said the area where Hill found the files is a public disposal location. The incinerator is on Blackbridge Road in Manchester Township.  Anyone can go there to dump waste, but O'Connor found it odd that someone \"would choose that level to get rid of documents.\"  The waste authority has a confidential destruction program with most medical offices. In those cases, a representative from the office brings the files and either tosses them in the incinerator themselves, or watches someone do it, and then gets a certificate of their destruction.  By the time O'Connor was contacted for this story June 9, anything in those dumpsters would have been destroyed, and cleaning crews would have picked up debris on the ground, she said.",

    "summary": "The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), which operates the Metropolitan Hospital Center (Metro- politan), values the importance of protecting the confidentiality of our patients' medical records. Therefore, we regret to inform you of an incident that resulted in the possible unauthorized disclosure of your protected health information (PHI), including such information as your name, medical record number, medical diagnosis, physician's name, and limited sensitive medical information. Although we have no evidence that your PHI was inappropriately used, we are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to inform you of this incident in writing. We also want to assist you by providing you with the steps that you can take to protect yourself from any harm that may result from this incident. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: By way of background, HHC has implemented an information governance and security program that, among other things, monitors and detects all email communications that contain PHI and other confidential information that are sent outside of HHC's information systems without proper authorization. The incident in question, which occurred on January 15, 2015, was discovered on March 31, 2015 when, in the course of HHC's monitoring of outgoing emails, we identified an email that contained PHI, including yours, which a Metropolitan employee improperly sent from his HHC email account to his personal email account. While there is no indication that the employee improperly used the information contained in the email, its transmission was unauthorized and certainly not condoned by Metropolitan. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident and advising you of the actions that we have taken and the ones that we recommend you consider taking to protect yourself from any possible adverse effects that could arise as a result of this incident. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE BREACH: Metropolitan has promptly taken a number of steps in response to this incident. First, we interviewed the responsible Metropolitan employee and examined his HHC email account to ensure that we identified all the sites to which the email and spreadsheets were sent. We also reviewed the employee's personal email account, and were present to ensure that the employee deleted the email and spreadsheets from his personal email account. Second, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity theft protection at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.",

    "summary": "St. Elizabeths Medical Center said Friday it is notifying 6,831 patients that their billing information, including credit card numbers and security codes, may have been compromised when documents the hospital planned to shred were removed by a vendor from a building scheduled for demolition.  The papers did not include personal medical information and so far, there have been no reports that any of the billing data contained in the documents has been misused, according to hospital officials.  St. Elizabeths, in Bostons Brighton neighborhood, released a statement saying it was alerted Feb. 3 by an individual who reported finding papers from the hospital blowing through a field in Charlestown. They contained cashiers receipts for credit card payments made by five patients at St. Elizabeths surgical day center and other outpatient services.  While the individual reported seeing other papers but did not retrieve them, St. Elizabeths said representatives sent to the scene were unable to find any other documents. The hospital is owned by Boston-based Steward Health Care System, a chain of community hospitals.  St. Elizabeths Medical Center had hired certain trusted vendors to begin clearing out the building on Jan. 30, 2012, the hospital said in a statement. All materials containing either a patient name or personal information were supposed to have been shredded.   Hospital officials have no evidence that information for more than five patients was lost, but said they decided to alert all patients whose information had been stored in the office where the five patients records were kept. The receipts found included patients names, hospital account numbers, and credit card numbers, security codes, and expiration dates.  We take patients information very seriously, and were reviewing our policy, and our training procedures to make sure this never happens again, said hospital spokesman Chris Murphy.  The incident marked the second health care data breach in the region in recent weeks. On March 23, CVS Caremark Corp. said it had mistakenly sent letters to about 3,500 Tufts Health Plan members, giving them personal information about the medical conditions and medications of other members enrolled in a supplemental Medicare plan managed by Tufts.  That mistake was caused by an unspecified programming error by CVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefits manager for the Tufts Medicare Preferred Plan.",

Army veteran and hospital patient Paulnhu Nguyen said he found a large stack of patient records containing personal information, such as social security numbers, date of births and full names, in a dumpster by the hospital after his appointment on Thursday.  \"When I threw the trash from my pocket in the dumpster, I took a look and observed files. It just didn't look right,\" Nguyen said.  The 33-year-old said he flagged down a Veterans Affairs employee, who called the Veteran Affairs police to get the files and take a report.  He hopes the issue is fully investigated and more oversight will be put in place.  \"I want whoever is the perpetrator... (to be) held accountable, not just slapped on the hand. I want them to actually sit there and say, 'Okay, this is serious stuff and this shouldn't be happening period,'\" Nguyen said.  Veterans Affairs officials said they were conducting an investigation to determine \"the contents of the documents, the circumstances surrounding the disposal, and what mitigation efforts can be enacted to protect our Veterans' personal information. Any breach of patient information is unacceptable and we will move aggressively to correct this issue,\" according to a statement.",

    "summary": "PA health system reports 144-patient data, identity theft  In whats turned out to be a multi-layered case, 144 patients of Community Hospital in Chester and Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland, PA had their names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers stolen in an IRS tax fraud sting from January 2008 to September 2011. Rafael Henriquez Polanco, 30, and wife, Yanira Lopez, 27, according to delcotimes.com, allegedly filed fraudulent tax returns with fake W2 forms, sought $1.7 million in refunds and ended up with $257,710 in return money from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The couple had paid hospital employees to steal confidential medical forms and from there they would use those forms to steal patient identities. The couple is facing charges ranging from conspiracy to defraud the government, aggravated identity theft, passport fraud and presentation of an immigration application containing a false statement. The report also says that Lopez was charged with wire fraud and is looking at 52 years in prison if convicted while Polanco faces 32 years in jail if convicted. The U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Security Service, the Department of Labor, IRS Criminal Investigations, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations handled the case and charges. But one has to wonder whether the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plans on getting involved in the case to see if Crozer could have prevented the patient data theft. Polanco and Lopez were Crozer Keystone Health System and, according to philly.com, Crozer spokesman Grant Gegwich said two employees, non-professional employees of the hospital employees, have been terminated for their involvement. While there were no other details, Gegwich said procedures for handling and disposal of documents containing patient information have been modified. Considering that Gegwich said the hospitals were notified of the information theft in October 2011, will those modifications be sufficient if HHS or the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) comes knocking?",

    "summary": "Personal health information about young mothers and their babies was stolen from the parking lot of the local health unit after an employee left files and a laptop in a vehicle, health officials say.  The thief made off with health information of about a dozen families that had been left in a locked case inside a bag with the laptop.  \"It's definitely something that is of concern to us,\" Dr. Christopher Mackie, medical officer of health for London and Middlesex County, said Tuesday.  The medical notes were for mothers attending baby clinics to get help for issues ranging from checking their babies' weights to overcoming challenges with breast feeding, he said.  \"It is not believed that the loss of this information could result in any significant harms to the client,\" he wrote in a report to the health board that meets Thursday.  Employees of the Middlesex-London Health Unit are prohibited from leaving medical records, paper or electronic, in their vehicles.  As to what has happened to the employee who left the files in a vehicle July 3, Mackie wouldn't disclose specifically what had been done but said that there had been followup.  The theft occurred in the farther of two employee lots from the health unit at 50 King St.  Mackie doesn't believe the thief was able to access files in the laptop because of a number of safeguards:  The health unit's practice is to encrypt all agency laptops. A username and password are needed to gain access to the device. Information technology staff were able to trace the laptop while it was connected to the Internet and wipe the data from it remotely. Health unit officials will send out notices to affected families and will contact Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner to inform them of the privacy breach.  The breach follows more notable alleged thefts reported this year:  The health records of Toronto Coun. Rob Ford were repeatedly breached in hospital while he battled cancer.  Criminal charges have been laid after a massive privacy breach at Scarborough's Rouge Valley Health System that saw the identities of new moms allegedly sold to a firm offering education investment vehicles. Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins has promised to introduce legislation in the fall that would deliver tougher penalties to those who pry into health records.  ",

Approximately 39,000 patients received letters about the breach in which hackers accessed protected patient information, including demographic information, medical record numbers, insurance information and Social Security numbers. Seton was notified of the breach on Feb. 26.  \"We value the privacy and security of protected information, and we are committed to protecting the confidentiality and privacy of our patients and employees,\" said Jes_s Garza, Seton Healthcare Family president and chief executive officer. \"It is our priority to support those who have been affected.\"  Usernames and passwords for the email accounts were immediately shut down, and Seton launched a thorough investigation. Computer experts were able to conduct an analysis of information contained in the affected email accounts, determine the scope of the incident and identify all the individuals affected.  \"The organization is taking all necessary and appropriate steps to prevent a recurrence,\" Garza said.  He said Seton will continue to implement administrative, technical and physical safeguards against unauthorized access of protected information.",

Additionally, investigators said he stole patient information from emergency room data sheets that had been thrown in the trash back in August 2011. Memorial HealthCare says that none of the stolen patient records included medical data.  Parsons, Amber Sasha-Rashawn Simmons and Joshua Clayton Thomas then used the data to file online fraudulent 2011 tax returns for 10 former Memorial Healthcare patients and did $818,000 worth of damage. While the patient names weren\u2019t publicized, eerily enough, federal prosecutors did say that the data was stolen from both living and dead patients. Parson was terminated upon the hospital learning of the theft last March.",

    "summary": " The New York City Health and Hospital Corp. (HHC) said that personal information of nearly 1.7 million hospital patients, staff, vendors, and contractors was stolen from a GRM Management Information Services van.  The data breach affected patients, staff, vendors and contractors at the Jacobi Medical Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, and their two affiliated health centers. The personal information was collected over the past 20 years and included names, addresses, social security numbers, patients medical histories, and the occupational/employee health information of staff, vendors, contractors, and others.  HHC stressed that the files are not readily accessible without highly specialized expertise and data-mining tools, and there is no evidence to indicate that the information has been accessed and misused. At the same time, HHC admitted that it did not know where the files are.  The loss of this data occurred through the negligence of a contracted firm that specializes in the secure transport and storage of sensitive data, but HHC is taking responsibility for providing information and credit monitoring services to any affected individual who may be worried about the possibility of identity theft, said HHC President Alan D. Aviles.  The 14-hospital system said it was providing free credit monitoring and fraud resolution services for one year to the nearly 1.7 million people affected. According to the Ponemon Institute, data breaches cost $204 per compromised record. That figure would place the cost of this data breach in the range of $350 million.  To recoup the cost, HHC said it was suing GRM Management Information Services to recover all of the costs associated with notifying all affected individuals, and to pay for other damages related to the loss of the data.  HHC said it reported the data breach to state and federal oversight, regulatory, and consumer protection agencies. Agencies notified include the New York State Attorney General, the New York State Office of Cyber Security, the New York State Consumer Protection Board, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and three nationwide consumer reporting agencies.",

A source tells WZZM 13 News that an off-duty employee was in the emergency room when he saw an attractive female. He took a picture of her back side and posted it on Facebook. His message read, \"I like what I like.\" The woman was not identified and her face could not be seen.  The employee who posted the picture was fired and so was everyone that liked it.  On Thursday, Spectrum would only say that it \"Took appropriate action.\"  The Spectrum source tells WZZM that it was another employee who notified administrators about the posting.  Leek says it's a lesson for all; when it comes to social media, be careful what you say and always err on the side of caution.  Among those who were fired include a registrar, a physician's assistant, and an emergency room doctor. Not all were direct employees of Spectrum; some worked for a company that provided employees to the hospital.",

    "summary": "Perhaps some recent news about reality television show star Kim Kardashian can be viewed as beneficial to the public in that it could help spread the word on patient privacy problems across the country. Kardashian was among the patient whose records were accessed inappropriately at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles between June 18 and June 24. The Los Angeles Times reported that six workers were fired for the internal breach, but hopefully this case will help alert the public of ongoing health data security issues and spark conversation within the industry to reevaluate celebrity patient privacy procedures.  Kardashian gave birth on June 15 at Cedars-Sinai to North West (yes, thats her real name) and according to Reuters, the organization contacted her shortly after checking out of the hospital to alert her that her data had been breached. Exactly what patient information, such as medical or financial data, was viewed has yet to be reported.  Los Angeles healthcare organizations such as Cedars-Sinai often have to deal with high-profile patient records being targeted during internal breaches and this Cedars-Sinai case was no different, as five of the employees accessed a single patient record the other viewed 14 different records.  Cedars-Sinai said that three community physicians, Dr. Sam Bakshian, Dr. Abraham Ishaaya and Dr. Shamim Shakibai, violated hospital policy by offering their user names and passwords to employees, who then used the logins to access confidential patient records, including Kardashians. And according to a Cedars-Sinai statement, four of the six workers who logged onto the hospitals information system without permission to access patient records were local physicians employees that had hospital staff privileges. The others were a research assistant and volunteer.  David Blake, Cedars-Sinais chief privacy officer, said in a statement to the Times that the hospital has a high standard for security and that unauthorized access to any patients record is, quite simply, unacceptable.  Though theres a strong chance that employees werent trying to do much beyond look at the records in efforts to find Kardashians. But Cedars-Sinai was smart to act swiftly in firing all of the employees involved and banning them from accessing its patient data from another organization in the future. Healthcare organizations can only do so much to train employees and when they give out passwords to their underlings who arent supposed to have access, it makes their job to protect data even harder.  Other high-profile patient privacy breaches at Los Angeles healthcare organizations include data belonging to late actress Farrah Fawcett, Britney Spears and Maria Shriver being inappropriately accessed at UCLA Medical Center.",

We recently became aware of an incident that involves patients health information.  For affected patients whose contact information is available, we sent notice of this issue through the United States postal system. The purpose of this web notice is to alert affected patients that we were unable to contact by mail. If you did not receive a letter and believe this situation may apply to you, please call toll-free 1-877-215-3618, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and provide the following ten-digit reference number: 5897011714.  On November 26, 2013, Geisinger-Bloomsburg Hospital became aware that on an unknown date some protected health information (PHI) created and stored by the former Bloomsburg Hospital was unable to be located in an archive of laboratory records filed by year. The PHI, which is believed to have consisted of copies of specimen pathology reports and specimen blocks of tissue for procedures that patients may have had performed during calendar years 2006 and 2007, is presumed lost without documentation of proper destruction.  The information would typically include the patients name, medical record number, diagnostic description and impression of the tissue under review. No financial information, including social security numbers, was part of this protected PHI.  The Bloomsburg Hospitalwhich became part of Geisinger Health System on July 1, 2012, completed a thorough search to locate the missing records. In addition, we have properly secured the remaining records and undertaken a review of storage practices to confirm compliance with the law and Geisinger Health System policies and procedures.  At Geisinger, we take our responsibility to protect personal information seriously. We regret this incident, apologize for any inconvenience it may cause our patients, and remain dedicated to safeguarding patient information.  Sincerely, Lissa Bryan-Smith Chief Administrative Officer Geisinger-Bloomsburg Hospital  John Gildersleeve Privacy Officer Geisinger Health System  Geisinger-Bloomsburgh informed HHS that 3,101 patients were affected.

The doctor, identified as Nikita A. Levy, 54, was let go by Johns Hopkins Medicine earlier this month after a colleague alerted security staff to the allegations, hospital officials said. They said Levy had been capturing images of patients with personal photo and video equipment.  Police uncovered what they called an \"extraordinary\" amount of evidence at Levy's Towson home.",

    "summary": "The University of Pennsylvania Health System revealed Monday that some patients' privacy was accidentally breached because of misprinted bills.  One of Penn's billing vendors, RevSpring of Wixom, Mich., had a malfunction in its printing operation. As a result, some patients received bills containing both their own correct information and an unrelated patient's information on the reverse side of the statement.  The inadvertent information included the unrelated patient's name, physician, types of services and tests, and amount owed.  \"Social Security numbers, dates of birth, diagnoses, and insurance numbers were not printed on these\" misprinted bills, Penn said in a statement.  More than 500 erroneous statements, affecting more than 1,000 patients, were mailed, although Penn spokeswoman Susan E. Phillips said she did not have an exact number.  The vendor discovered and reported the problem to Penn on Dec. 5 and has since worked to investigate it, notify affected patients, and make sure the error does not recur, Phillips said.  \"We haven't had any angry patients,\" she added. \"Just people calling to say, 'Isn't this odd?' \"  Patients with questions about misprinted bills may call Penn's hotline at 877-309-0186.  The federal HIPAA law protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information, and requires businesses to provide notification following a breach.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has discretion to impose monetary penalties, depending on the nature and extent of the violation and the resulting harm. If the violation is unintentional and is corrected within 30 days, there are no penalties.",

On Feb. 7, a car belonging to an employee of the Emory Dialysis Clinic was one of several broken into, according to Vince Dollard, spokesman for the university's health services. An employee of Health Systems Management, which operates the clinic, reported that his work laptop was stolen, Dollard said.  The computer had a one-word password and was not encrypted, Emory said.  Although patient information was on the laptop, the information was very limited, the university said in an emailed statement.  \"There were no patient Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, financial credit card information, diagnosis or physician names in the laptop,\" Emory said.  Information on the laptop includes last names and first names for about half of the 826 patients, and the first initial for the remaining patients. The patients' dates of service and graphs of blood flow tests were also stored on the computer, the university said.  \"HSM has instituted process changes to protect against a similar event occurring in the future,\" the university said. \"Medical information stored on HSM laptops is required to be encrypted, as well as password-protected.\"  All of the patients whose information was on the laptop were notified by mail, Dollard said.",

    "summary": "Hurley Medical Center inadvertently released the names and social security numbers of an undisclosed number of employees and retirees while trying to fix issues with its health care plan.  According to a news release from Hurley Medical Center, the hospital recently discovered that an email attachment sent to a \"limited number of employees\" contained the names and Social Security numbers for an unspecified number of employees and retirees who are enrolled in the Hurley group health plan. Hurley officials said there is no evidence at this time the information has been misused, but arrangements have been made for identity resolution services through First Watch Technologies for those affected.  \"We take the privacy of our employees very seriously. The incident was thoroughly investigated and appropriate corrective action is being taken.\" Said Ilene Cantor, Administrator of Marketing, Community and Public Relations for Hurley Medical Center in a statement.  The email was sent after the administrator of the health plan informed Hurley in May that it erred when it calculated some co-payments. Hurley sent the email May 13  describing the co-payment errors to help some employees answer questions they might receive from affected personnel. According to the release, the names and Social Security numbers of the impacted employees and retirees were accidentally attached to the email. Hurley said the email did not include any medical information, claim information or any other personal information.  Hurley declined to disclose how many names and Social Security numbers were released.  The error was discovered by Hurley on May 14, and the hospital said it immediately identified every individual who received the email and directed them to permanently delete the email from their computers. Hurley confirmed the email has been permanently removed from all computers.  Hurley has notified all individuals impacted by the disclosure, according to the release, explaining the details and providing a toll-free phone number to assist those who have questions. Hurley is also offering at no cost to impacted individuals access to identity resolution services through First Watch Technologies.  \"We take our obligation to protect our employees' personal information very seriously and sincerely regret this incident. Immediate steps were taken to reemphasize our policies already in place and conduct refresher training on those privacy policies,\" said Melany Gavulic, RN, MBA, President & Chief Executive Officer of Hurley in a statement  Individuals who may have been affected by this incident can call 866-221-0155 Monday through Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 7 p.m.",

A former Navy electronics technician who used his technical acumen to enable his crimes and avoid detection, Cullen got away with medical murder in at least nine hospitals over the course of his 16-year career. (He was finally arrested in 2003; he\u2019s currently serving life in Trenton Maximum Security Prison.)   Cullen was the master of a new machine that hospitals started using to track and distribute drugs, a computerized cabinet called a Pyxis MedStation. Manufactured by an Ohio company called Cardinal Health, the machine is essentially a metal drug cash register with a computer screen and keyboard affixed to the top.Cullen had realized that if he placed an order of the drug for his own patient, then quickly canceled it, the drug drawer popped open anyway. He could simply take what he wanted without recording it in the system. It was that easy.",

    "summary": "The tech, Rachael Rapraeger, pleaded guilty earlier this month to 10 misdemeanor charges of reckless conduct and one felony charge of computer forgery. She was sentenced to serve up to six months in a detention center, to serve 10 years on probation during which she can't work in the health care field and to pay a $12,500 fine.  The reasons she gave were vague. She told police she had personal issues that caused her to stop caring about her job, that she had fallen behind processing the piles of mammogram films that stacked up. So she went into the hospital's computer system, assumed the identities of physicians, and gave each patient a clear reading, an investigative report says. That allowed her to avoid the time-consuming paperwork required before the films are brought to a reading room for radiologists to examine, her lawyer Floyd Buford told the AP.  Her actions were uncovered in April 2010 after a patient who'd received a negative report had another mammogram three months later at another hospital that revealed she had breast cancer. As hospital staff began to investigate, it was determined that the doctor whose name was on the faulty report had not been at the hospital the day the report was filed. Rapraeger quickly confessed to her supervisor that she was responsible and was fired from her job about a week later, according to an investigator's report.",

    "summary": "In the first case of its kind (that I am aware of), the California Attorney Generals office filed a complaint against the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (Kaiser) alleging a violation of Californias unfair competition law (Business and Professions Code sections 17200-17210) arising out of a personal information security breach and delayed notification.  This lawsuit is interesting because the AGs office alleges that the timing of Kaisers notification violated Californias breach notification law (California Civil Code section 1798.82, subdivision (a)).  It also comes on the heels of the Target breach where people are questioning  Targets 3-week delay in providing its initial notification.  As discussed further below the fold, the outcome of this case could impact when and how companies subject to Californias breach notice law provide notice to affected individuals.  Moreover, considering Californias influence in the privacy regulatory space it could have nationwide implications.   Section 1798.82 of Californias breach notification law provides as follows (emphasis supplied): Any person or business that conducts business in California, and that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, shall disclose any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the security of the data to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. The disclosure shall be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, as provided in subdivision (c), or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. While Californias law does not explicitly define most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, Californias Office of Privacy Protection recommends that notice be provided within ten (10) business days of an organizations determination that personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.  With respect to Kaiser, the CA AG alleges that on September 24, 2011, Kaiser learned that an external hard drive containing the personal information (SSNs, DOBs, addresses, etc.) of Kaiser employees had been sold to a member of the public at a thrift store.  On December 21, 2011 Kaiser secured possession of the drive and conducted a forensic examination.   The initial forensic examination allegedly revealed the presence of over 30,000 SSNs and other personal information.  According to the CA AG, Kaiser continued its inventory of the drive through mid-Feburary 2012 (approximately 5 months after initial discovery and 3 months after obtaining the drive).  Still later, Kaiser provided notice to 20,539 California residents on March 19, 2012 (approximately 6 months after its initial discover and 4 months after obtaining the drive).  Based on the facts set forth above, the CA AG alleges that Kaisers delay between obtaining the drive in December 2011 and notification to affected individuals in March 2012 amounts to an act of of unfair competition under section 17200 of Californias Business and Professions code.  In particular, the CA AG alleges that even though Kaiser did not complete its analysis of the drive until February 2012, it had sufficient information to notify at least some affected individuals between December 2011 and February 2012.  In the eyes of the CA AG, the failure of Kaiser to provide notice on a rolling basis, even if its investigation was not complete, amounted to a failure to provide notice in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay under Californias breach notice law (California Civil Code section 1798.82, subdivision (a)).  Under Californias Business and Professions code section 17206, Kaiser could be ordered to pay $2,500 for each violation of section 17200 (if late notice to each affected individual is a separate violation, Kaiser could be looking at significant penalties).

    "summary": "The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) has found Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in breach of the Data Protection Act after sensitive information was sent to the wrong address.  The information was disclosed when eight letters about patients were sent to one of the people affected in July 2013. The letters should have been sent to a GPs surgery. Six of the letters included sensitive medical information relating to the patients treatment.  An ICO investigation found that the employee responsible for the mistake hadnt received any form of data protection training. While the health board had introduced mandatory data protection training for all staff in April 2013, by February 2014 only 6.5% of staff had received it. The health board informed the ICO that it did not anticipate providing the training to all of their staff until April 2015.  ICO Assistant Commissioner for Wales, Anne Jones, said:  We accept mistakes can happen, but organisations must make sure employees handling sensitive personal information are given the necessary training to carry out their role. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board failed to do this.  The health board has now signed an undertaking committing the organisation to improving the training provided to its employees. This includes prioritising staff who manage sensitive information as part of their core role, or who work in a lead information governance role within the organisation by ensuring theyve received data protection training by 30 September 2014. The health board will also make sure their staff complete refresher training every two years.  These improvements will significantly reduce the risks of a future breach occurring and help to keep patients information secure.\" ",

    "summary": "When you go to the hospital you expect your private health information to be kept private.  But 2 NEWS Investigates uncovered a lawsuit by two local women that alleges they repeatedly had the privacy of their health information violated by employees at Kettering Health Network, also known as Kettering Adventist Healthcare.  Every time you see a new doctor you probably sign a notice of privacy practices. Its part of a national law called HIPAA.  Its meant to keep things like your visits to the doctor and even your billing information from getting into the wrong hands.  But Kettering Health Network and its former employee are being sued accused of not following that law.  Vicki Sheldon and her daughter Haley say they feel violated.  I dont know if I could feel anymore violated then if I had just been stripped down naked and walked in front of every executive in Kettering, said Vicki.  They claim Kettering Health Network employees wrongfully accessed their health information.  Vicki said Kettering first alerted her to the violation. According to Vicki, Kettering told her that her ex-husband, Duane Sheldon who worked in the Administration Department at Kettering, had inappropriately looked at her records.  I received some reports directly from Kettering, from their system. Quite frankly when I got them I was very disturbed by the number of people who had no reason to be in my records had been in my records apparently just whenever they felt like looking.  Vicki said that report showed her records were looked at again and again for 15 months by people who she says had nothing to do with her care.  Both women believe Kettering Health Network did not have the appropriate procedures in place to protect their private records.  Theyre suing both Kettering Health Network and Duane Sheldon for invasion of privacy and negligence.  Duane Sheldons attorney told me hes declining an interview but provided a brief statement that says in part, much of the Plaintiffs Complaint is inaccurate and personally inflammatory.  According to his attorney, Duane Sheldon no longer works for Kettering Health Network.  Kettering declined to comment directly about the lawsuit.  But regardless of the legal side of things, 2 NEWS Investigates wanted to know how safe your information really is and if there was in fact a breach at a health network that serves thousands of people in the Miami Valley.  The Director of Compliance Program, Megan Brickner who oversees patient protection agreed to answer questions.  Natalie: Was there a HIPAA violation at this network by employees?  Brickner: I cannot comment to that in particular, but I can say again we have this Protect program that we are continuously looking at the risk landscape and if we see something we need to address then we do so,  Brickner said not every employee has access to every part of a patients record. The access they get is based on their job title.  She also said Kettering has a system in place that notifies them if a patients record was accessed by the wrong person.  There are reports that get ran. We also have a third party come in every year looking at our IT infrastructure, she said.  Brickner wouldnt go into detail about the types of reports that are run or disclose the latest results of them.  But she does say if your records were looked at inappropriately its required by law to let you know.  Natalie: Should patients be worried about their medical information?  Brickner: To be honest with you, I think everyone needs to always be vigilant. I think its very important to be your own advocate.  Natalie: Are you running those reports and is everything working?  Brickner: Yes. Everything is working. I will tell you how well its working. We do have a commitment to protecting patient privacy and securing their information.  Vicki said those answers are not enough.  I would hate for anybody to have to go through this. Its humiliating. Its degrading. It takes away your power, said Vicki Sheldon.  According to public court documents Duane Sheldon and Kettering are asking that the lawsuit be dismissed, arguing that individuals cant sue over HIPAA violations.  2 NEWS Investigates went to the top legal expert in the state to find out.  My understanding of the law is that individuals do not have the right to sue under the HIPAA law but what they could do is file under a tort law of common law that exists in every state and file an action under that, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.  DeWine said a states attorney general and the US Department of Health and Human Services are the ones who can take legal action when someone believes their health information was violated.  Vicki and Haleys attorney said the government is overburdened and this case is about more than HIPAA violations. Its about an invasion of privacy.  Its a new and emerging area of the law therefore in Ohio, this type of breach doesnt have a lot of case law behind it, but there are other states notably Indiana and California where theres been significant privacy violations, said Vicki and Haleys attorney, Rob Croskery.  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, you have the right to see and get a copy of your health records and who has looked at them. All you need to do is ask your hospital for them. In most cases they have up to 30 days to provide the copy.",

    "summary": "In the process of researching this breach, I discovered a press release from UHS-Pruitt that seemed to contradict the media notice above. Then I realized the press release was from a UHS-Pruitt affiliate, UniHealth SOURCE, and it was reporting a second breach that also involved a laptop theft.  The December 6th  press release (pdf) reads, in part:  UniHealth SOURCE, a provider of case management services in the Georgia Service Options Using Resources in a Community Environment (SOURCE) Medicaid waiver program, is committed to our clients privacy and compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations. The purpose of this notice is to identify a recent incident involving the theft of a computer laptop belonging to one of our employees. The laptop contained very limited information about current and former clients: specifically, the first and last name and, in some cases, potential diagnoses. The laptop did not contain any other identifying information, such as Social Security numbers or dates of birth, which could be used by an identity thief to financially exploit our clients. Although the laptop did contain the names of approximately 4,500 current and former clients of UniHealth SOURCE, UniHealth Select, and Blue Ridge Community Based Services, the level of financial risk to these individuals appears to be very low.  On October 8, 2013, the employees laptop was stolen from her car at her home. The theft was reported to the police, and we continue to cooperate fully with the investigation. The computer laptop was used by the employee to access and maintain certain patient information for the purpose of quality assurance audits for health care services provided by the above-referenced offices. Upon discovery of the theft, all access through the employees stolen laptop to computer applications, such as electronic medical records, was cut off immediately. Nevertheless, we determined that the above-described patient information was stored locally on the computers hard drive. We have not received any indication that such information stored on the computer has been accessed.",

Following the breach, the CE reminded employees of its safeguards policy, provided additional training to workforce members who are authorized to take laptops and mobile devices home, and improved safeguards by instituting random audits to ensure that unencrypted ePHI is not stored on computers and mobile devices.  The CE also updated the computer usage agreement for employees and sanctioned the workforce member for violating its policy.

    "summary": "As a home health care provider, Debra Bush had two responsibilities to care for the elderly and the dying and to hire fellow nurses for her employer.   But Bush had another activity on the side: identity theft.   \"Debra Bush started to utilize information that she obtained from her applicants, individuals that she was supposed to be hiring,\" said U.S. Postal Inspector Keith Moore.   As the contact person, Bush had access to each job applicant's personal information.   \"She had access to all of her applicants' information including Social Security number, date of birth, and all of their personal information,\" Moore said.   Bush also was targeting her Virginia patients.   \"She actually stole information from some of her hospice patients without their knowledge,\" Moore said.  Postal inspectors describe Bush as brazen.   \"She actually used people's personal identifiers to obtain utility services to her home, her power bill, her water bill, all that was in some of her victims' names,\" Moore said.  After executing a search warrant, inspectors sat down with Bush to discuss the allegations.   \"At that point she just started giving us one lie after another,\" Moore said.   Inspectors knew she was lying but couldn't get to her admit exactly why she committed her crimes.   \"She had enough money to pay her bills, to take care of her household,\" Moore said, \"but, unfortunately, she decided to use other people's information for nothing more than just as a hobby of sorts.\"   Could patients or job applicants have done something to protect themselves? Moore said it was unlikely.   \"In this situation, the company was very legitimate,\" he said. \"They had a great track record. Unfortunately, they just hired a person that, for whatever reason, want to steal.\"  Bush was sentenced to probation for her role in this scheme.",

    "summary": "The last of five people accused of tax refund fraud involving identity theft from medical records pleaded guilty Friday for his role in the scheme, U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer said.  Michael Ali Bryant, Sr., 41, of Lauderdale Lakes, faces up to 12 years in prison at his sentencing scheduled in April, prosecutors said.  A confidential informant approached Bryant to buy drugs through Bryants connection to a medical service provider. Bryant said he had no access to any drugs but he could sell medical records containing the personal information of hundreds of patients that could be used to file fraudulent income tax returns, according to court documents.  Bryant sold the source 10 pages with up to 25 names on each and gave specific instructions on how to file the tax returns online to get tax refunds in the patients names without their knowledge, the court records showed.  According to the complaint, Rosier worked for a company that performed medical laboratory tests where she had access to medical records with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (personal identity information or PII) of individuals in the course of her employment with that company. During the conspiracy, Rosier provided access to the companys database which allowed other coconspirators to steal PII from the company. Found on the computer of one of the coconspirators was the PII of over 1,300 individuals. Rosier knew that her co-conspirators would use the PII for fraudulent purposes. Moye also obtained information from the companys database, which he used to obtain credit cards and other identification in the name of a patient.",

Today, Justin Fenton of the Baltimore Sun reports that Johns Hopkins Hospital has reached a proposed settlement for a lawsuit filed last fall. The settlement involves $190million.  As Fenton notes, the settlement, if approved, might be the largest of its kind:  The settlement may be the largest of its kind. A class-action suit involving a Delaware pediatrician convicted of recording assaults on hundreds of children led to a $120 million settlement in 2012. That same year, a Connecticut hospital settled for about $50 million with 150 victims of an endocrinologist who used a medical study as a pretense to take obscene photographs of children.  []  In court papers, plaintiffs also contended that Levy engaged in doctor-patient boundary violations during the course of his patients treatment, including an excessive number of unnecessary pelvic exams and engaging in inappropriate physical contact. Some said Levy practiced without medical professionals on hand as observers, a routine hospital practice for the safety of patients and doctors.  Hopkins said it had identified more than 12,500 potential victims.  Read more on Baltimore Sun. Associated Press provides additional coverage.  Somewhat surprisingly, this incident does not seem to be recorded at all in HHSs public breach tool. Its therefore possible that OCR is still investigating this incident and that Johns Hopkins could be facing other consequences apart from the lawsuit.",

    "summary": "Tens of thousands of medical marijuana patients across the country are receiving a mass mailing from Health Canada exposing them as medical cannabis users and many are now in panic mode.  The letter, which Health Canada says was sent to 40,000 people, comes in a white envelope, and has a return address with the words Medical Marihuana Access Program written across the top, followed by the patients name and address. Many people say their privacy has been violated and fear their houses may be robbed and their home growing gardens targeted.  Im outright panicked, said Multiple Sclerosis patient Suzi Berardini, who also suffers from trigeminal neuralgia. She said the mailman who dropped the letter off smirked when he handed her the envelope. Its terrifying. So many levels of terrifying.  Laurie MacEachern, who represents medical marijuana patients as director of the Medicinal Cannabis Patients Alliance of Canada Inc. said she is supremely concerned about the information being released to the public.  One patient said she got her mail and the delivery man said, I didnt know you smoked, said MacEachern.  MacEachern said previous letters did not have the word marijuana on it. Almost a dozen other medical marijuana patients called Metro with similar concerns. Most werent willing to comment on the record for fear of being exposed even more.  Health Canada Deputy Minister George Da Pont said the format of the mailing was the result of an administrative error. He said the letters outlining changes to the Marihuana Medical Access Program, which take effect next spring, were sent to 40,000 patients.  This is not standard Health Canada practice, he wrote in an email to Metro. On behalf of Health Canada, I deeply regret this administrative error. Health Canada is taking steps to ensure this does not happen again. Protection of personal information is of fundamental importance to Health Canada. We are in discussion with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.  Among the reasons for changes to the rules, which will prohibit patients from growing their own marijuana at home, cited in the letter is concern that participants in the program will be targets of home invasions.  A spokesperson with the office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner Heather Ormerod said in an email:  Our Office was not notified by Health Canada of this incident. We were made aware of it by a number of concerned individuals who contacted our Office. We have since received complaints and we will be investigating this matter, Omerod wrote. We have been in touch with Health Canada and are currently gathering further information.  Why people say they are upset: Suzi Beradini says she no longer feels safe in her Ottawa home after a letter from Health Canada exposed her as a medical marijuana patient.  Any Joe Blow who works at Canada Post now might know where I am and that Im a patient and can easily think, well, if shes a legal patient, she must have meds, she told Metro after receiving a letter.  I feel like a I have a giant bullseye on my roof.  Rick Gauthier is now considering moving from his small town in Quebec, as he says everybody likely knows he is a medical marijuana user after receiving his letter in the mail Thursday.  I think Im unsafe now.  He worries Canada Post workers may even steal his medicine.  Michael Greenblatts letter went through several hands before it was delivered to his room at a nursing home in Markham. When the letter finally reached his room, he said the delivery person said,  I would sure like to be in this program.   First of all, its my private medical issue, Greenblatt said. Its not up to Health Canada.  He has filed a complaint with Canadas privacy commission.",

    "summary": "ManagedMed Inc. (A Psychological Corporation), based in Los Angeles, recently notified the California Attorney Generals Office of a breach involving patient scheduling information.  According to their July 17th letter to patients, submitted to the state on July 25, some patient scheduling information located in their computerized system had been viewed via an unsecured webpage by two non-ManagedMed people.    ManagedMed learned of the breach on May 13 and launched an immediate investigation that revealed that from approximately March, 2013 through May 15, 2014, it was possible for unauthorized individuals to access the calendaring system in certain circumstances.  Seth Hirsch, PhD, President of ManagedMed, informed patients that An individual who knew the website address for the calendaring system could access patient scheduling information for the period between November 1, 2010 through May 15, 2014. In addition, with respect to a limited number of patients, it was possible for an unauthorized person to access the ManagedMed calendaring system by performing a Google search of a patients name and then clicking on a link to the calendaring system website.  Information in the calendaring system included patients names,  telephone numbers, names of care providers, limited notes, and the date of the appointment. In certain cases, Dr. Hirsch wrote, the notes contain abbreviations about the general type of visit scheduled, for example f/u (follow up),  i/e (initial examination) or notes about medication or a test the patient was scheduled to take.  Considering that this is a mental health facility, exposure of such information could be somewhat embarrassing or problematic.  No Social Security numbers or drivers license numbers were accessible via the calendaring system and it was not possible to access patients actual medical records, which are not maintained on a computer, Dr. Hirsch explained.  The calendaring system was secured on May 15, and other than the two individuals who accessed it without authorization on May 13, ManagedMed is not aware of any other access to the system or any misuse of information.  No services were offered to the patients and they were given no advice. ManagedMed did apologize for the incident and reassure patients that the system was now secured.  You can read the notification here (pdf).  And no, this incident is not (yet?) up on HHSs public breach tool. Im wondering what they might do in this case as exposing information about patients at a mental health facility is pretty serious, even if only two people actually accessed the information.

    "summary": "Nazanien Ebrahimi, a/k/a Nancy Ebrahimi, 32, of Fairfax County, Virginia, was indicted by a federal grand jury on February 26, 2015, on charges of wire fraud, health care fraud, aggravated identity theft, and making false statements relating to health care matters. Dana J. Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; and Andrew G. McCabe, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBIs Washington Field Office, made the announcement after Ebrahimis initial appearance today in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson. If convicted, Ebrahimi faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each wire fraud count, 10 years in prison on each health care fraud count, a mandatory two-year consecutive sentence for each of the aggravated identity theft counts, and five years in prison on each count of making a false claim regarding health care matters. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Criminal indictments are only charges and not evidence of guilt. A defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty. According to allegations in the indictment, Ebrahimi, a law school graduate, owned and controlled Dental Arts Group, which purported to provide administrative and consulting services to dental practices. Through her control of Dental Arts Group, Ebrahimi allegedly carried out a scheme to steal the identities of various individuals, including other dentists, and use their identities without their knowledge to open merchant accounts with consumer dental financing programs, including CareCredit. To gain access to these programs, Ebrahimi submitted false and misleading enrollment applications. Once the fraudulent CareCredit merchant accounts were opened, Ebrahimi allegedly billed patients for charges that were inflated, never authorized, or never approved. For example, under one CareCredit merchant account that Ebrahimi opened without the victims knowledge, patients disputed nearly 50 percent of the total amount Ebrahimi charged for purported dental services. At the time, the dispute rate for all other CareCredit dental merchants was less than 1 percent. Furthermore, Ebrahimi allegedly submitted false CareCredit charge slips that purported to bear the signatures of patients. The indictment further alleges that Ebrahimi defrauded Humana, a private health insurer, by submitting false and inflated insurance claims for dental services that were never rendered. Ebrahimi allegedly deposited the profits earned from her scheme in various bank accounts that she controlled. Finally, the indictment alleges that Ebrahimi manufactured, or attempted to manufacture, and destroy various patient records. This case is being investigated by the FBIs Washington Field Office. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Lowell and Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye are prosecuting the case. A copy of this press release may be found on the website of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Several laptops were stolen from the administrative office of Aspire Indiana on Nov. 7, 2014.  An investigation found that emails on the laptops contained client and employees' Social Security numbers, names and addresses as well as personal health information of Aspire clients. 1,548 of those notified had their Social Security numbers compromised. The organization routinely collects data on HIV care data, substance abuse treatment and mental health services.    \"Our organization is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal information in our control, and we sincerely regret this incident occurred,\" said Aspire's president and CEO Rich DeHaven, in a public notice. \"We have taken steps to enhance our security, including upgrading our alarm and security systems.\"",

    "summary": "he Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla is offering free credit monitoring for up to 1,519 veterans whose personal information, including social security numbers, was inadvertently emailed to an external education partner on Nov. 1.   #VA places the highest priority on safeguarding the personal information of our veterans, said Medical Center Director Brian Westfield. When an incident such as this is discovered, we will immediately take prompt remedial action such as notification to the veteran  even if the risk to veterans is very slight.   #The email and its attachment were recovered within 10 minutes of being sent. Walla Walla VA Privacy Officer Laurie Beauchamp investigated the incident, and reported the external education partner is held in high regard.  I am confident appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate any harm to our veterans. stated Beauchamp.  #She added that the employee involved received additional training on keeping electronic files protected to eliminate this type of situation from occurring in the future.  #Every veteran whose name was in the email attachment will receive a letter of notification and, where appropriate, an offer of credit monitoring for one year at no charge.   #Veterans, who believe they may have been affected by this incident, but have not been notified by VA, may verify whether their information was involved by writing to:    #Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center; ATTN:  Privacy Officer; 77 Wainwright Dr.; Walla Walla, WA, 99362.  #Affected veterans can request a free credit report for one year from one or more of the three national credit bureaus by calling 1-877-322-8228 or by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com.  Information about this and other protections, including placing a fraud alert on credit accounts, is available by calling the Federal Trade Commission at its toll free number, 1-877-438-4338, or by visiting its website, http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft.",

    "summary": "University Urology, P.C. of Knoxville, Tenn. released a statement on April 11 that detailed how 1,144 patients data had been exposed in 2013 and early 2014.  Though the information was limited to patient names and addresses, University Urology said in statement posted on its website that Social Security Numbers, financial account information, clinical information were not exposed. According to the statement, an administrative assistant had gathered the data in efforts to sell it to a competing provider to help gain patient business. Patients began calling University Urology on February 13, 2014 to alert the organization that the competing provider had unexpectedly been soliciting their business.  We understand that any breach of protected health information is a concern for our patients. We sincerely regret this situation occurred, said Peggy Kares, HIPAA Security Officer at University Urology, P.C.  Following the breach, University Urology spoke with the breaching employee, terminated their employment, revoked their access to protected health information (PHI), changed internal passwords and agreed with the competing organization that received the patient information to destroy it. The organization added that employees would be retrained on patient privacy best practices.  University Urology, P.C. is notifying by mail the patients impacted by this breach. While it appears that the information subject to the breach was to be used for patient solicitation and there is absolutely no indication that the information may be used for purposes of identity theft, patients may choose to monitor their credit card, bank, or other financial statements for signs of fraud and identity theft. The level of culpability on the part of the competing provider in this breach is the most interesting part, considering it came to an agreement with University Urology. HealthITSecurity.com will post more details on the breach as they come out.",

    "summary": "In July, Las Vegas-based Western Regional Center for Brain & Spine Surgery (WRCBSS) began notifying patients that their personal information  including Social Security numbers  might have been stolen by a former employee and used for fraudulent purposes.  How many victims? 12,000, according to HHS.gov.  What type of personal information? Names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and WRCBSS patient billing account numbers.  What happened? A former employee allegedly stole patient data and used it for fraudulent purposes, and is now the subject of a law enforcement investigation.  What was the response? WRCBSS is reviewing its internal policies and procedures, as well as its technology safeguards. All impacted individuals are being notified.  Details: WRCBSS was notified by law enforcement on May 13 of a breach of information related to its billing files. The former employee who is the subject of the investigation worked for WRCBSS in 2011 and 2012. HHS.gov lists the breach as having occurred from Nov. 28, 2011, to June 29, 2012.  Quote: Presently, we are unable to identify the specific patients whose personal health information was actually stolen nor do we know which of those patients whose information was stolen was also used for fraudulent activities, Robin Hasty, office administrator for WRCBSS, wrote in the notification to patients. We are therefore notifying all patients whose personal information was in our billing system at the time of the breach.

    "summary": "Central Dermatology Center (Central) announced on November 7, 2014 that on September 25, 2014 it became aware that one of its servers had been compromised by malicious software (malware). Central immediately consulted with forensic IT experts to identify and remove the malware and determine exactly what information on the server may have been accessed. The malware was removed and the server has been disconnected from Centrals system.  The information on the server that may or may not have been accessed included patients name, address, phone numbers, date of birth, social security number, billing and diagnostic codes, insurance company, insurance co-payment information, healthcare provider, employer information, sex, treatment date, account balance, email address, and race.  Based on Centrals forensic investigation to date it is believed that patient bank account and payment card information were not compromised and electronic medical records were not on this server as they were encrypted by Central prior to the malware being placed on the server.  Taking aggressive action early and confronting this issue is consistent with the practices core value of behaving in an ethical and transparent fashion, said Greg Catt, Practice Administrator at Central Dermatology Center & Carolina Medi-Spa. Central hired a prominent forensics security expert firm and an information technology firm that investigated this incident, reviewed all systems, and Central has improved our security wherever necessary to help protect our community. On behalf of the people of Central Dermatology Center, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  As part of our investigation in this matter, we consulted with an IT forensics firm and a separate IT company who specialize in this area. The investigation revealed that malware compromised a password protected Central server on or about August 9, 2012 despite safeguards in place, including software on the server designed to prevent such malware. We contacted, and will continue to work with, local law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, North Carolina Attorney General, nationwide consumer reporting agencies, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regarding this matter.  Central is notifying potentially affected patients and patients are being offered free credit monitoring and identity theft protection.

La Toya Yvette Tillman, 33, used her position at Gastroenterology Consultants in Hollywood to access the Memorial Healthcare System database through her computer at work to steal patient identities, including names, dates of birth, and social security numbers, so that she could sell them, according to court documents. Investigators say Tillman sold an individual approximately 2,000 identities for $1 each, and the individual told her that he used the identities to file fraudulent tax returns. In addition, in her car when she was arrested, Tillman had a list of 114 identities, including names, dates of birth, and social security numbers. Tillman pled guilty to one count of possessing fifteen or more unauthorized access devices with the intent to defraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. Sentencing is set for October 24th, 2014. Tillman faces up to ten years in prison for the access device charge, and a mandatory term of two years in prison, consecutive to any other term in prison, for the aggravated identity theft charge.",

    "summary": "GP surgery bosses have apologised to parents after letters containing personal information about children were sent to the wrong addresses.  Bosses at the Latham House Medical Practice in Melton have apologised after up to 200 child flu vaccination consent forms were sent out to the wrong addresses.  These forms gave the child's name, date of birth, full address, registered GP and Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) number.  Latham House Medical Practice manager Alison Hipkin said she was not sure how many forms had been sent to the wrong addresses.  She said: \"We do not know if six, 16 or 60 or more forms went to the wrong addresses.  \"It was down to human error and we apologise to the parents concerned.\"  The error was spotted after parents in the town started receiving letters with consent forms containing details of other people's children.  Mum-of-five Kim Hendy, of Drummond Walk, Melton, said she received a letter about the flu vaccination on Saturday October 10.  She said: \"There was a standard letter about the consent form and another sheet of paper which was the consent form.  \"When I looked at the consent form it had the details of someone else's child on.  \"I could not believe it. Luckily I knew the other mum and was able to warn her.  \"What worries me most is who has got the details of my child and other children too.  \"There are lots of undesirable people out there. If this sort of information - the name of a child, their age, their address, gets into their hands, knows what might happen.  \"You read about children being snatched. it is very, very worrying.  \"They might apologise but I still do not know who got my child's personal information and what they have down with it.\"  A spokesperson for the practice said: \"It was brought to our attention this Monday that an administrative error occurred whilst sending out flu immunisation letters to a few households in Melton.  \" Invitation letters were sent to parents/guardians of children between the ages of two and four offering them a seasonal flu immunisation.  \"Whilst the letters have gone out to the correct patients, we have since been informed that the consent forms, in some instances, have been attached to the wrong letters.  \"This has been fully investigated and reported to the correct authorities.  \"The staff members have been informed of the error and all appropriate actions have been taken by the Practice to prevent a repeat of this incident.  \"The breach of confidentiality is regarding the child's name, address and date of birth. No medical information has been disclosed.  \"Any breach of data security will always be taken seriously by the Practice and we have mailed out apology letters to patients who might have been affected by this administrative error.\"  The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which upholds information rights, said no complaints about the Melton practice had been received.  An ICO spokesperson said: \"If people feel their information has not been processed in line with the law, they should take this up with the organisation in question.  \"If they are not satisfied with the response they receive they can contact us.\"",

    "summary": "One of the busiest medical clinics in Santa Fe has reported a security breach affecting patients who were treated at Santa Fe Family Health Center during two weeks in July. The clinic, 2801 Rodeo Road, released a statement Friday afternoon saying the breach occurred July 14 for patients who had office visits between June 30 and July 13. We are sorry to report to you that on July 14, Santa Fe Medical Group became aware of a breach to your personal health information, the company said in a statement. An unidentified man entered the clinic at about 3 a.m. July 14, according to the statement. There was a theft of voice-recorded files from the providers, as well as cash and checks taken from the safe of Santa Fe Family Health. No credit card information was stolen, the clinic said. The clinic is owned by Atrinea Health, a company founded by Dr. Philip Briggs, a physician who started practicing in Santa Fe and has since opened offices statewide. In addition to Santa Fe Family Health, Atrinea also owns Coraz_n Family Health on Rodeo Lane and clinics in Espaola, Los Alamos, Las Vegas, N.M., Albuquerque, Rio Rancho and Los Lunas. Santa Fe Family Health offers both urgent and primary care. No other clinics were affected, said Tammy Payne, medical records supervisor with Atrinea. She could not say if patients were notified before Friday, adding that the company is doing what it is required under federal laws. We had to do an investigation with regards to the information, Payne said. She said Atrinea was providing the press the same information as it was providing patients, and that she could not elaborate. In its statement, the company said it filed a police report July 14, initiated a forensics security investigation, changed locks as well as policies and procedures, and initiated operational or technology updates or changes triggered by the incident to improve confidentiality. Celina Espinoza, a Santa Fe Police Department spokeswoman, said the initial dispatch log from 1:46 p.m. July 14 indicates that deposits were stolen from the safe, it but does not refer to other items. I dont know if they made us aware there was personal information, she said. A full incident report was not available Friday. It is possible, Espinoza said, that further investigation by the company showed the possibility of identification theft and that is why the company was now alerting the public.

    "summary": "An emergency room doctor from St. Albert has been suspended for at least a month because she illegally tapped into restricted medical files. The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta announced this week that it had found Deanne Dee Gayle Watrich, an emergency room doctor and a St. Albert resident, to be guilty of unprofessional conduct. Watrich had previously admitted to unprofessional conduct at a hearing tribunal held by the college last November. Specifically, the tribunal wrote in its ruling, Watrich accessed the electronic health records of three people 21 times between Aug. 5, 2009, and May 2, 2010, without having a patient/physician relationship with those people. Its okay for doctors to access patient records if they are actually treating those patients, explained college spokesperson Kelly Eby, but not otherwise. She accessed the electronic health records of three people who she was not treating, she said. Its an invasion of privacy. It also violates the provincial Health Professions Act and Health Information Act, and goes against the Canadian Medical Associations Code of Ethics and the colleges standards of practice. Watrichs case started when the provincial privacy commission began investigating a complaint from a man who had requested an Alberta Netcare log. The log showed that nine doctors, none of whom were treating him, had accessed his electronic health records. He alleged that Watrich might be the one responsible. The man listed his partner and mother as co-complainants, both of whom had their files accessed by three other doctors. Watrich admitted to the privacy commissioner and to the tribunal that she was responsible for accessing these restricted records using the logins of 12 other doctors. On 21 occasions, the tribunal heard, Watrich used computers in the emergency department of the Edmonton Misericordia Hospital to access these records after the previous user had not logged out, and did so knowing that her personal ID would not show up in the computers logs as a result. Watrich was in a personal relationship with one of the complainants when she accessed some of the records, the tribunal found, and in a relationship with the former spouse of said complainant when she accessed others. I dont know why I logged in to their Netcare and why I did it so many times, Watrich said at the hearing last November. It didnt actually give me any power. It didn't give me anything. In retrospect, she believed accessing these records might have been a way for her to cope with the difficult divorce and child-custody proceedings her partner was going through at the time. Watrich told the tribunal that she was humiliated and embarrassed by her actions and deeply disappointed in (herself). She had apologized to the complainants, and paid a significant monetary settlement to them in a related lawsuit. Covenant Health (which runs the Misericordia) had also put a reprimand on her record. Even though Watrich didnt disclose any of the information she accessed, the tribunal ruled, her actions were done repeatedly and with intent to deceive, and impugned the reputation of her fellow physicians.",

Confidential files pertaining to the condition of the stricken German Formula One legend may have been on a laptop belonging to Dr Johannes Peil.  His surgery in Bad Nauheim, Germany, has broken into last weekend by thieves who got in via a basement cellar.  If the report in the Mail is correct, it could spark fears of a repeat of a scandal last year in which Schumacher's medical records were offered for sale to media companies.  Schumacher's family threatened legal action if the documents found their way into the public domain. A helicopter medic was arrested in the investigation into the leak, only to be found hanged in his cell in Zurich, Switzerland.  Dr Peil is part of a team of medical experts caring for Schumacher as he recuperates from a ski crash in the French Alps in late 2013.  Recovery has been slow for the seven-time F1 champion, who emerged from a coma last June. It is understood he is partly conscious of his environment, but official updates have been scarce.",

Falck had been using an Other World Computing (OWC) hard drive to hold patient data (it\u2019s unknown what exactly was on there) for about a month until it stopped working and needed to be returned to OWC on Nov. 28, 2012. While Falck expected the patient data on the device to be wiped clean, OWC ended up selling it to a German doctor named Gerhard Binker with the patient data still viewable. Binker emailed Falck in January to alert her that there was still patient data on the device.",

    "summary": "A whitehat hacker from the Baltimore suburbs went too far in his effort to drive home a point about a security vulnerability he reported to a client. Now hes unemployed and telling all on reddit.  David Helkowski was working for Canton Group, a Baltimore-based software consulting firm on a project for the University of Maryland (UMD), when he claims he found malware on the universitys servers that could be used to gain access to personal data of students and faculty. But he says his employer and the university failed to take action on the report, and the vulnerability remained in place even after a data breach exposed more than 300,000 students and former students Social Security numbers.  As Helkowski said to a co-worker in Steam chat, I got tired of being ignored, so I forced their hand. He penetrated the universitys network from home, working over multiple VPNs, and downloaded the personal data of members of the universitys security task force. He then posted the data to Pastebin and e-mailed the members of the task force anonymously on March 15.  One day later, the FBI obtained a search warrant for Helkowskis home. While no charges have yet been filed against him, Helkowskis employment with Canton Group has ended. And yesterday, he took to reddit to tell everyone about it in a post entitled IamA Hacker who was Raided by the FBI and Secret Service AMAA! To prove his identity, he even posted a redacted copy of the search warrant he was served.  How did the FBI track him down so fast? It turns out that Helkowski told just about everyone (including co-workers) about what he was doing. And since the vulnerability he used was the same one Canton Group had reported to UMD on February 27, it didnt take a lot of sleuthing to follow a trail that pointed straight back to Helkowskis home in the Baltimore suburb of Parkville.  On the night of March 16, Helkowski and his wife arrived home to find the raid in progress.  There were 12 or so people. I wasn't home when they busted in my door. They actually busted in the side door. My dog was home. He ran out the doggie door then ran out the gate that they had opened. They let my dog run away basically.  I was driving up to my house, returning from dinner, and all the lights in my house were on, many cars parked out front, and cars in my driveway. I saw people walking around out front. I wondered why there was a party at my house.  As I slowed down to take a look, they yelled at me, pointed a gun (I saw one at least), and ordered me to stop the car and put my hands out the window. I did so. They then told me to use one hand to shut off the car and hold the key out the window as well. I did that. They took the key, and then demanded I get out of the car.  They then [put my hands] against the car and frisked me. They immediately took my cellphone from me, and then led me inside. Helkowski asked permission to call for his father to retrieve his dog while agents detained him and his wife. An agent called Helkowskis father, saying he was a friend and had noticed the dog was loose, Helkowski said. His father came to the scene to retrieve the dogand was then detained by federal agents. My dad of course had to accuse me in front of the FBI Are you gonna learn your lesson now and not do stuff like this? or something like that... in front of the FBI. Geez dad. Thanks.  Helkowski said that he cooperated fully with the agents. During the RAID I provided my 20+ character system encryption password, my Keepass password, the location of my keyfiles, and a full description of everything. I basically 'confessed' everything to the FBI already. My stance is that I did nothing 'morally wrong.' My attempt the entire time has been to help the university improve their security.  In a March 20 staff memo published by the University of Maryland from Ann G. Wiley, UMDs interim vice president and chief information officer, Wiley wrote, The FBI has informed the University that the intrusion resulted in no public release of any information and no damage to the institution, except for the release of personal data of one senior University official, who has been notified. We are unable to comment further on the intrusion at this time.\"",

    "summary": "Hackers have infiltrated the National University of Singapore's (NUS) backend systems and made away with a trove of information, including staff usernames, domain information and hashed passwords. University has confirmed the incident but noted that the affected data is not confidential.   According to a report Thursday on IT security Web site Secure Computing Magazine's (SC Magazine), hacker group Team Intra had infiltrated the tertiary institution's database by exploiting a SQL vulnerability. The hackers apparently felt the urge to do so after the NUS Web site, upon receiving probes, generated an error message which stated: \"If you're trying to use the SQL error message to dig for juicy information, get lost.\"   The hackers reportedly retorted: \"I made it my personal goal to get in and r*pe their sorry asses for the message.\" The group subsequently published the stolen information which included NUS staff usernames, domain information and hashed, or encrypted, passwords, it added.  SC Magazine also noted that it had notified the Singapore university about the breach.  [UPDATE: Jan. 6, 9.45 a.m.] SC Magazine has since updated its report with a statement from the NUS' head of IT security, Yong Fong Liang, who said the security breach affected a server which did not contained any sensitive information. Yong was quoted to say: \"[The] hackers infiltrated into the system exploiting an application security loophole. This system is a departmental server containing public data... The leaked passwords are for local accounts that allow access to the departmental server only. They are not NUSNET accounts and passwords.\"  In an e-mail statement to ZDNet Asia, an NUS spokesperson confirmed the hack. \"On Jan. 5, 2012, the university discovered that one of our Web servers had been hacked into. We have looked into the matter and ascertained that the information stored on the server is not of a confidential nature. In addition, no information has been removed or tampered with,\" he said.  \"As a precautionary measure, the passwords of all affected accounts have been reset. The affected server has also been disconnected from the network,\" he noted, adding that the affected server was an isolated, standalone system that was not linked to the NUS network.  The spokesperson also noted that the university is investigating the matter and will put in place appropriate measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.  [UPDATE: Jan. 6, 3.44 p.m.] In a comment on SC Magazine, a commentor who claimed to be part of Team Intra, said the hack was not targeted and was simply a demonstration of how weak NUS' security was.  \"Just clearing this up, it is not our intention to LEAK any private data to the public. We are just here to show the poor security standards some Web sites have. We have our best intentions. NOTHING was changed on the server, and NO ONE was harmed,\" he said.  \"[NUS tried] to prevent hackers by sending out a simple statement, 'If you're trying to use the SQL error message to dig for juicy information, get lost.' However [it did] nothing to actually ensure that [it is] safe,\" the commentator said, adding that it only took 5 minutes of WAF (Web application firewall) bypassing to get past the university's security infrastructure. He also noted that while the passwords obtained were hashed, the team took less than 4 to 5 hours to decrypt all the hashes.  He revealed that someone else previously also managed to access the same database. He explained that when his team searched for one of the hashes, it found the hashes on a password-cracking forum InsidePro. \"No one on that server is safe, if this is absolutely the case,\" he said. \"National University of Singapore had and still has many more holes in its Web site.\"",

He said the doctors assumed the email came from the I-T department when they opened it but instead were phishing scams.  The emails contained patients' names, medical record numbers and limited information associated with a clinic or hospital visits. The emails did not list credit card or Social Security numbers.  The doctors first noticed the problem when emails disappeared from their accounts. Emails also were sent from their accounts to people outside of the health system, Casey said.  Some patients at UC Davis Medical Center said they were still concerned about the incident.  \"It's a little scary, still not good for the people who come here, \" UC Davis Medical Center visitor Luis Baron said.

According to the Journal Star, the U.S. Attorney's Office recently filed a federal charge against the 22-year-old alleging he intentionally accessed protected information last spring before the system was breached on May 23. Documents such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, grades and financial aid information dated back to the spring semester of 1985.  The breach included information of about 650,000 students, alumni and applicants, however, once it was discovered by a technical staff member at the university last May, it was shut down within hours. Immediately after the breach was detected, university officials contacted the students whose bank account information was stored in the school system, according to the source.",

    "summary": "The Saskatchewan Health Ministry is writing to 58 West Nile virus patients about a potential breach of their private health information.  It happened during a health management class in 2005 and 2006 at the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology.  Up to 140 students in a health information management course were using information from West Nile patients that was on file from 2003.  West Nile fever, caused by the virus, typically comes with mild flu-like symptoms, but in rare cases can lead to paralysis or even death.  The information was aggregated, but there was a source file students had access to that contained the individual health records.  Officials say it's highly unlikely, although not impossible, that students actually read the names and associated health files.  In a news release, Sara Hawryluk, director of health information policy at the ministry of health, said the government is sorry and is working with the privacy commissioner to make sure nothing like this happens again.  The potential breach was discovered when SIAST sent the old records back for an update. At that time, the health ministry discovered what had happened.",

A document included in a 222-page School Committee packet remained online for the better part of a week, before being taken down Monday.  Awareness of the data, which details private information for the out of district placements of 83 students and rates their parents according to their cooperativeness with the district, raised outrage on social media over the weekend.  []  The seven-page memo from Rick Pelletier, Director of Student Services, to the Superintendent was included in the School Committee packet as part of its budget justification package last week. The memo includes a spreadsheet that listed all the students with out of district placements  and also included a ranking on parental cooperativeness. The amount of data included could indicate a violation of state and federal law.  The list, which replaces student names with numbers, remains in alphabetical order. Information included the students current grade, the out-of-district school, the last school attended, the year the student began attending the new school, information on whether or not the decision was made by the IEP team, a legal settlement (typically kept strictly confidential), or if the student moved in from another town, and miscellaneous detail such as the involvement of the Department of Children and Families, passage of MCAS assessments, and more.  The office of Student Services also published its rating of parents according to their cooperativeness with the district.

    "summary": " A man who purchased $5,600 in jewelry at a store in Tustin using three fraudulent credit cards, one belonging to actor Marlon Wayans, was arrested Thursday in Los Angeles after a months-long investigation, said Tustin police Lt. John Strain.  The investigation also uncovered from his home computer about 1.8 million Social Security numbers from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, where Kim had been employed as an auditor. Veterans Affairs' officials have said only 185,000 numbers are at risk because many were repeated in the file.  Tae Kim, 28, was booked at Orange County Jail and is being held in lieu of $1 million bail after being arrested at 5 p.m. Thursday at a car wash in Koreatown, police said.  On April 7, two Asian men identified as Kim and Justin Hong, purchased jewelry from Jewelry Exchange at 15732 Tustin Village Way using three skimmed cards belong to three different victims, one of whom was actor Marlon Wayans, Strain said.  Wayans is best known for his role in the now defunct WB series The Wayans Bros. and the Scary Movie film series.  Kim was on formal probation and a search was conducted at his Los Angeles residence June 14 where a computer was taken as evidence. After a search warrant was obtained, police found the Social Security numbers hidden in a computer file.  Kim had worked at the Veteran Affairs office since 2003 when he was a student at USC but quit in February of this year when he discovered a background check would be conducted.  The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs verified that Kim did not have permission to possess the Social Security numbers. Officials have notified several victims from Orange County, police said.  In May 2006, Social Security numbers for 26.5 million U.S. veterans were stolen in an apparent random burglary in Maryland from a Veterans Affairs employee's house after he took the laptop containing the information home without authorization.  Authorities from the Orange County District Attorney's Office, LAPD and U.S. Marshalls have been attempting to arrest Kim since August.  Kim is believed to be a member of Koreatown Gangsters, police said. He faces eight different charges, including commercial burglary, fraudulent use of an access card, identity theft, criminal street gang activity and computer access fraud.  Justin Hong is in L.A. County Jail awaiting trial for a gang related murder. A warrant for his arrest is also pending filing with the court.",

These services were used by more than 24,000 subscribers, including bank and department stores and can be reached from more than 35,000 locations.  Way back in July 1984, a is a global credit information group, TRW (now Experian); was hacked into. A total of 90 million records were hacked into. All of this was possible due to a secret password that got leaked out along with manual on the systems operation.  Computer buffs (as they were known in those days) using home terminals broke into TRW Information Services computers holding credit histories of 90 million people.  TRW Information services is/was a credit bureau that transmits over telephone lines such information as Credit histories, employment records, bankruptcies, loan delinquencies and Social Security Numbers. These services were used by more than 24,000 subscribers, including bank and department stores and can be reached from more than 35,000 locations.  The TRW systems were hacked into after hackers got hold of a secret password and a manual on the systems operation. The password was leaked out way in 1983 but TRW officials were not notified until July 1984. TRW officials admitted that although the break-in allowed users to read confidential files, those users would not be able to change the files. Changes were submitted monthly on tape and the files are not altered through the on-line computer systems.  TRW Officials said that the password and the manual were obtained from a Sears Roebuck store in Sacramneto that subscribes to the TRW system. Hackers eventually posted the code number on an electronic Bulletin Board which many computer users with the right equipment can read by using a telephone. It has been a common knowledge for months among many computer community that the TRW files could be entered easily and credit records read.  The breach was first reported by Newsday, which quoted unnamed computer hacker as saying the TRW system was hacked not only to read credit records, but also to  expedite credit card fraud by finding out whether a person whose credit card was stolen had a large card limit. TRW said the leaked password was changed and that no other codes were believed to be available to hackers. The Newsday story, however, quoted sources who said that other code that provide access to other TRW files are still circulating.",

Authorities say roughly 400 patients from Louisiana and beyond have to go through the process of reclaiming their lives.

Detectives say she admitted stealing personal information from a hospital database to write counterfeit checks.  \"Late last week, LSU HCSD received from law enforcement copies of the check images printed by the employee and seized from her residence. Immediately upon receiving this information, HCSD began to determine which of its patients were affected and to notify them by phone and letter as required by HIPAA and other federal regulations.\"",

Experts are now probing into the origins of the virus, which could be a stray one or planted as a result of a hacker attack on JAXA. Among the leaked data JAXA cited the rocket\u2019s parameters, specifics of its engine maintenance and protocols on agency\u2019s meetings.  Japan started developing the next-generation solid propellant rocket, called Epsilon, two years ago. It is superior to the existing H-IIA rocket due to its smaller size, which will allow it to lift light satellites into orbit at a quarter of the H-IIA launch cost.",

    "summary": "A British man has been arrested in England and charged by the United States and Britain with hacking into U.S. government computer systems, including those run by the military, to steal confidential data and disrupt operations, authorities said.  Lauri Love and three co-conspirators allegedly infiltrated thousands of systems including those of the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. space agency NASA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to a U.S. grand jury indictment made public on Monday.  Love, 28, and the unnamed co-conspirators, including two in Australia and one in Sweden, then left \"back doors\" in the networks to later retrieve data, and intended that their activity \"disrupt the operations and infrastructure of the United States government,\" according to the indictment.  \"Such conduct endangers the security of our country and is an affront to those who serve,\" U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey, who announced the charges, said in a statement.  Love was charged in Britain with violating the Computer Misuse Act, and charged in the United States with accessing a U.S. government computer without permission and conspiracy, authorities said.  Fishman said the hacking took place from October 2012 until this month. He said it compromised personal data of U.S. military personnel, and information on defense budgets, contract bidding, and the demolition and disposal of military facilities, and caused millions of dollars of losses.  The arrest comes as authorities worldwide coordinate efforts to combat cybercrime. On October 10, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel issued a memorandum emphasizing a need to safeguard even unclassified technical data against cyber intrusions to help protect U.S. military superiority.  \"The cyber threat presents a significant risk to national security and military operations,\" Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart said. \"We take this threat seriously and work diligently to prevent future intrusions.\"  CHAT ROOMS  Love lives in the Suffolk village of Stradishall, about 70 miles northeast of London. He was arrested at his home on October 25 by the cybercrime unit of Britain's National Crime Agency and other officials, authorities said. He has been released on bail until February 2014, an NCA spokeswoman said.  U.S. prosecutors said the scheme by Love and his co-conspirators involved the installation of malware in the hacked systems, creating \"shells\" and \"back doors\" that allowed them to return later to steal data.  The indictment described how Love, who was also known as \"nsh\" and \"route\" and \"peace,\" at times allegedly used internet chat rooms to discuss the hacking and efforts to conceal it.  In an October 2012 conversation described in the indictment, Love discussed the hacking of an Army Corps database that might have yielded 400,000 email addresses, and asked a co-conspirator to \"grab one email for curiosity.\"  Nine months later, in July 2013, he appeared to boast about accessing a NASA database, telling another co-conspirator \"ahaha, we owning lots of nasa sites,\" the indictment said.  Later that month, he told the same co-conspirator after another hacking: \"This ... stuff is really sensitive. ... It's basically every piece of information you'd need to do full identity theft on any employee or contractor for the (agency),\" according to the indictment.  Prosecutors said hacked systems were located in places including Vicksburg, Mississippi, and the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, and also included a server containing information about military personnel at Fort Monmouth in New Jersey.  Love faces up to five years in prison and a fine on each U.S. criminal count. Prosecutors said he faces additional charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, stemming from other unspecified \"intrusions.\"  The cases are U.S. v. Love, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey; and U.S. v. Love, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, No. 13-mj-00657.

    "summary": "Unknown attackers compromised a download mirror server for the SourceForge software repository, rigging the installer package for phpMyAdmin, a popular Web-based MySQL database administration tool, with a backdoor.SourceForge is a Web-based collaborative software development and repository system that hosts over 324,000 software development projects and serves 46 million users. The service is operated by Geeknet, a company based in Fairfax County, Virginia, U.S.  \"One of the SourceForge.net mirrors, namely cdnetworks-kr-1, was being used to distribute a modified archive of phpMyAdmin, which includes a backdoor,\" the phpMyAdmin development team said Tuesday in a security advisory. \"This backdoor is located in file server_sync.php and allows an attacker to remotely execute PHP code.\"  The modified package was phpMyAdmin-3.5.2.2-all-languages.zip and, according to access logs from the compromised mirror server, it was downloaded by approximately 400 users.  An identifier of CVE-2012-5159 was assigned to the vulnerability introduced by the phpMyAdmin backdoor code. Security vendor Secunia rates the vulnerability as extremely critical because it provides system access and can be exploited remotely.  A module targeting the vulnerability was added to the Metasploit penetration testing framework on Tuesday.  The affected mirror server was based in Korea and was compromised on or around Sept. 22, the SourceForge team said Tuesday in a blog post. \"The mirror provider has confirmed the attack vector has been identified and is limited to their mirror,\" the SourceForge team said.  The mirror server was removed from rotation after SourceForge learned of the compromise on Tuesday. However, the team is still investigating whether the phpMyAdmin archive was the only package modified by the attackers.  The mirror provider appears to be a company called CDNetworks that specializes in Internet content delivery. CDNetworks has been operating SourceForge mirror servers in the U.S. and Asia since 2009. A spokeswoman for CDNetworks in the U.S. said she was looking into the incident, but was not immediately able to provide more information about the apparent security breach.  RESOURCES  WHITE PAPER SIP Migration: Addressing CIOs' Concerns  WHITE PAPER SBIC: Transforming Information Security SEE ALL   Go It's not clear why the rogue package modification wasn't detected earlier since by definition mirror servers should mirror the content from a central repository. \"Automated mirror validation occurs on an ongoing basis and SHA1/MD5 sums [file digital fingerprints] are provided for validation client-side,\" Rich Bowen, a SourceForge official, said Tuesday via email.  Users who downloaded and deployed the phpMyAdmin-3.5.2.2-all-languages.zip package recently are advised to check whether heir phpMyAdmin installations contain the rogue server_sync.php file. If the file is found, the software should be deleted and a fresh copy of the package should be downloaded.  Web server administrators are also advised to check the server logs in order to determine whether the backdoor was accessed and used to execute rogue code on their servers.  The phpMyAdmin development team regularly publishes the MD5 checksums for the software's official install packages on its website. For example, the legitimate phpMyAdmin-3.5.2.2-all-languages.zip archive has an MD5 checksum of \"6f284e973809af8cda998eeaa9aa7884\".  Users should calculate the MD5 checksum of the package they download and compare it to the one published by the phpMyAdmin developers in order to verify that it is legitimate. A modified package will have a different MD5 checksum.  In fact, users should always perform a checksum verification when downloading software for use on their computers or servers, whenever the developer provides an MD5 or other type of checksum for the installer. Some browsers, like Mozilla Firefox, have extensions that make checksum checking easier.  This is not the first time that a download server has been compromised and the installer of a popular application has been backdoored.  In June 2011, the WordPress development team warned that some fairly popular WordPress plug-ins had been backdoored through the official plug-in repository.  In July 2011, the maintainer of vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon), a popular FTP server software, announced that the master vsftpd download site was compromised and the software's official packages were rigged with a backdoor.  In December 2010, unknown hackers compromised the main distribution server of the ProFTPD Project -- another popular FTP server software -- and added a root shell backdoor to the source code. ",

    "summary": "A nationwide data breach has Jimmy John's with a fiasco on its hands.   The company released a statement today saying that it became aware of the incident at the end of July.  Many customers think that the place that promises \"freaky fast delivery\" took its time alerting them.  And that left many Jimmy John's customers that  with a bad taste in their mouths.  For more details including the reactions of employees and customers, watch the video for the complete report.   Eighteen locations were affected by the breach in Michigan including two in Sterling Heights, Novi, Livonia and East Lansing. Other stores were Madison Heights, Warren, Ypsilanti, Canton, Niles, Royal Oak, Bloomfield Hills, Marquette and Bay City.  For a full list of locations and addresses, click here.  An excerpt of the company's statement said:  \"We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have on our customers. Jimmy John's values the privacy and security of its customers' information, and is offering identity protection services to impacted customers, although Jimmy John's does not collect its customers' Social Security numbers.   To take advantage of these services, please visit Contacts & Information here.  For more information, call (855) 398-6442.   In addition, customers are encouraged to monitor their credit and debit card accounts, and notify their bank if they notice any suspicious activity. Additional recommendations for protecting your information can be found here.   Additional info will be posted at jimmyjohns.com.\"   ignature Systems responsible for the payment information leak at the 216 Jimmy John's sandwich stores Vendor of point-of-sale (PoS) equipment Signature Systems announced that an unauthorized person managed to infiltrate malware on its payment terminals in 324 restaurant locations across the United States.  The incident impacted credit and debit cards at 216 Jimmy Johns stores and franchised locations, announced by the sandwich chain on Wednesday.  Signature Systems has been blamed for compromising card data of Jimmy Johns customers, but the disclosure statement did not give any names, saying that an intruder stole log-in credentials from Jimmy Johns point-of-sale vendor.   In an official statement issued on Friday, Signature Systems informed that 108 other restaurant locations using its payment terminals were affected, apart from the Jimmy Johns ones. It took three months to clear all affected systems of malware  The first sign of intrusion was traced back to June 16, when an unauthorized person used Signature Systems credentials for remote access to the PoS systems in the restaurants.  Once logged in, the perpetrator proceeded to install malware designed to capture payment card data from cards that were swiped through terminals in certain restaurants.  The information exposed consisted of the name of the cardholder, credit and debit card number, as well as expiration date and verification code from the magnetic stripe.  After receiving alerts of a possible breach on July 30 and during the ensuing week, the company cleared the malicious software from the payment terminals in most of the affected locations.  Removing the malware from all machines was not possible until mid-September. In the case of Jimmy Johns, the last unauthorized access happened on September 5. Number of impacted customers is unknown  The company says that it could not identify the cards impacted by the incident and it does not have names or addresses of the potentially affected customers. As such, it falls in the hands of each individual that used their card at one of the compromised locations to notice fraudulent charges and notify the bank that issued the card.  A list of all affected locations and the timeframe of the compromise is provided in the disclosure announcement. In some cases, the breach lasted only a few days, but there are restaurants where even a three-month compromise period is given.  Most of the locations are pizza shops, but places serving other dishes are also on the list, such as Wings to Go, Costello's Italian Ristorante, Romanellis or Austin's Bar & Grill.  Signature Systems also provides details on what potentially affected customers can do in the case of fraudulent transactions on their cards.",

A total of 500,000 records, including customer credit card details, were leaked as a result of the hack, according to news reports.  WHMCS developer Matt Pugh wrote in a blog: \"The person was able to impersonate myself with our Web hosting company, and provide correct answers to their verification questions. And thereby gain access to our client account with the host, and ultimately change the email and then request a mailing of the access details.  \"This means that there was no actual hacking of our server. They were ultimately given the access details. This is obviously a terrible situation, and very unfortunate, but rest assured that this was no issue or vulnerability with the WHMCS software itself.\"  UGNazi compounded the problem by launching a large-scale distributed denial-of-service attack that froze WHMCS's Web servers.

    "summary": "Pune-based ElectraCard Services (ECS) said on Sunday that a data breach in a series of ATM fraud attacks in December last year appears to have happened outside of its \"processing environment\".  Last week, US authorities had brought to light a $45-million global cyber heist involving ECS and another company, enStage Inc, which operates from Bangalore. The two firms had processed card payments for two West Asian banks that were hit in the theft, according to people familiar with the situation.  The prosecutors did not name the two companies then but said one was based in India and the other in the US.  According to a US official and a bank employee, ElectraCard Services processed prepaid travel cards for United Arab Emirates-based National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAKBANK), which suffered a $5-million coordinated heist at ATMs around the world on December 21, 2012.  ECS said investigations show \"the PIN and Magnetic stripe data seem to have been compromised outside the ECS processing environment\".  It added in a statement: \"As already reported in the media earlier this year, there were fraud attacks which affected several institutions worldwide, including ECS, in December 2012.\"  US prosecutors said on Thursday that hackers broke into two card processing companies, raising the balances and withdrawal limits on accounts that were then exploited in coordinated ATM withdrawals around the world.  Ramesh Mengawade, CEO of ECS and its parent company, Opus Software Solutions, could not be reached through his assistant or by email on Saturday. Calls to the mobile phone of another company official were not answered.  enStage, which is incorporated in Cupertino, California, is the company that processed card payments for Bank of Muscat, according to a source close to the bank.  Bank of Muscat lost $40 million in a coordinated heist on February 19, according to Thursday's indictment. Officials at enStage could not be reached, either in Bangalore or in Cupertino.  enStage's CEO Govind Setlur has been quoted as saying in a media report that the company has implemented security enhancements and monitoring since the theft. \"Our customers were adversely affected by this sophisticated crime,\" Setlur was quoted as saying. \"We are deeply committed to information security, and we will continue to take all reasonable measures to ensure our networks are secured from criminal actors.\"  More work for big processors?  Bank of Muscat has not commented on the case.  MasterCard, the network under which the cards used in the heist were issued, has said its security was not compromised. ECS said MasterCard bought a 12.5 percent stake in it in 2010.  Cyber security experts said the global scope and speed of the $45-million bank theft was unprecedented. The global gang had operatives in 27 countries who fanned out to thousands of ATMs in a matter of hours, withdrawing money using fraudulent prepaid debit cards, according to US prosecutors.  The US Justice Department gave details of the heist on Thursday in an indictment against eight men accused of being the New York cell of the organisation. The department said seven of the men have been arrested.  The ringleaders of the global operation were believed to be outside the US, but US prosecutors have declined to give details, citing the continuing investigation. Germany is the only other country so far to announce arrests.  Eddie Schwartz, chief information security officer for RSA Inc, a firm that helps banks fight payment card fraud, said that it is not surprising that hackers would target banks that rely on Indian firms to process transactions.  Schwartz, who is based in Washington, said there is not as much government oversight in India as there is in the US and Western Europe.  \"Hackers view India as a target. It's got a fast-moving economy, a fast-moving IT infrastructure,\" said Schwartz.  Madeline Aufseeser, a senior analyst with Aite Group who follows payments processors, said she was relieved to learn that the case appeared to be limited to smaller processors.  \"It looks like an isolated, very targeted incident,\" she said, noting that the major firms in the industry have highly sophisticated protocols to limit fraud damages.  The big players include First Data Corp, FIS, Galileo Mastercard Inc's Mastercard Integrated Processing Solutions, Tsys and Visa Inc's Visa Debit Processing Service.  Philip Philliou, managing partner of Philliou Partners LLC, a firm that helps banks and retailers select payment processors, predicted smaller processing firms will lose business as a result of this theft. Banks will decide they are not willing to assume the additional risk that comes with using smaller firms, he said.  ",

    "summary": "Palestinian hackers of KDMS Team, the ones that have defaced numerous high-profile domains over the past days through DNS poisoning, have hijacked metasploit.com, the website dedicated to the popular penetration testing software Metasploit. They've also defaced Rapid7's website, rapid7.com.  \"Hello Metasploit. After whatsapp, avira, alexa, avg and other sites we was thinking about quitting hacking and disappear again! But we said: there is some sites must be hacked. You are one of our targets. Therefore we are here,\" the hackers wrote on the defaced websites.  \"And there is another thing. Do you know Palestine? There is a land called Palestine on the earth. This land has been stolen by Zionist. Do you know it? Palestinian people has the right to live in peace. Deserve to liberate their land and release all prisoners from Israeli jails. We want peace,\" they added.  It's uncertain at this point if the hackers have really hacked Metasploit.com and Rapid7.com or if this is another case of DNS hijacking. It's most likely the second variant.  In any case, I've reached out to Rapid7 to find out exactly. The post will be updated when they respond to my inquiry.  Updated to add that Rapid7's website has also been defaced.  Update 2. Rapid7's HD Moore has confirmed that the websites were hijacked through the registrar, Register.com.   \"Still having a tug of war with the Rapid7 domains, the attackers have the ability to change ANY Register.com domain, check yours,\" Moore warned on Twitter.  It's worth noting that Register.com is owned by Web.com, the same as Network Solutions, the registrar hacked when AVG, Avira and Whatsapp sites were defaced.  Update 3.  Rapid7 has provided the following statement regarding the incident:  \"This morning the DNS settings for Rapid7.com and Metasploit.com were changed by a malicious third-party. We have taken action to address the issue and both sites are now locked down. We are currently investigating the situation, but it looks like the domain was hijacked via a spoofed change request faxed to Register.com.  We apologize for the service disruption, and do not anticipate any further implications for our users and customers at this time. We will keep everyone posted as we learn more, and let the community know if any action is needed.\"",

    "summary": "In a scam never seen before in Ontario, a Toronto-area law firm lost \u201ca large six figure\u201d over the holidays after a virus gave hackers backdoor access to its bookkeeper\u2019s computer. The virus copied bank account passwords as she typed them.  The virus \u201ctricked the [bookkeeper] into giving the trust account\u2019s password to the fraudsters, allowing them essentially full access to the trust account, including the ability to go in, monitor it, and wire money to foreign countries shortly after deposits were made,\u201d Pinnington adds.  Pinnington believes the hacking took place after the bookkeeper clicked on a link, opened an e-mail attachment or downloaded something as mundane as a screen saver from the Internet.  The built-in program, in this case, was the Trojan banker virus. It has an ability to mimic a bank\u2019s web site and when a user types in a password, the program logs the keys and sends a transcript to the hackers in real time. An e-mail pretending to be from the bank may have provided the bookkeeper a link that launched into a spoof web site prompting her to log in, says Pinnington. But she couldn\u2019t successfully gain access using her primary password. Another window, also designed to look like the bank\u2019s web site, then asked her for her name and telephone number.",

    "summary": "Boomerang Rentals customers report fraudulent card charges (Update 2)  Posted by Dissent at 7:42 am Business Sector, ID Theft Jan 13 2015   And for Tuesday's edition of \"How Not to Handle a Reported Breach,\" we give you__.. (drum roll)__. Boomerang Rentals.  John Leyden of The Register provides a recap of what happened when customers started expressing concerns about fraudulent charges on cards they had on file with the video game rental service. Neil Bolt of PSU also provides details.  As of four hours ago, Boomerang tweeted:   So were they compromised, or is this yet another case where people have re-used login credentials and the logins were stolen from another site? We'll need to wait until Boomerang issues a more definitive statement. [Update 2: it's not from re-used logins from other sites. See comments below this post from users.]  A DataBreaches.net reader who contacted us to alert us to this incident, noted:  I had a look at it yesterday __ everything appears to run on one web server (also email, FTP etc). For example, payment details are taken on same server with their WordPress blog, which has an exploitable theme on it (they only pulled this yesterday, 4 days after the apparent breach).  Stay tuned, I guess__.  Update 1:  Situation Update: Boomerang Rentals 13th January 2015  What happened  On Friday we were contacted by a customer who was concerned that a fraudulent charge had been attempted on his credit card, and he was worried that our system had been compromised. He quoted another person who had made a comment on Twitter of a similar issue.  What we did We began an investigation as soon as additional concerns were raised. Credit card data is stored in a strongly encrypted format and not viewable to any internal staff, however, at that stage, we felt we should take the concerns seriously.  Over the weekend, we noticed other people online reporting similar issues and we became increasingly concerned. So, based on the information available at the time and conscious of the concern, we made the decision on Sunday afternoon to take the site off line while we continued our investigations.  Where we are  By Monday morning, we had been contacted directly by a small number of additional customers. We contacted the fraud department of our merchant bank, but they knew of no issue. We also contacted our payment gateway provider and they also had no concerns. They are assisting us in a consultative capacity.  By this time we could see lots of people talking about this online, but only a few people had contacted us directly.  To date we have not found any evidence of a breach of our systems. We are continuing to investigate and continue to take this issue very seriously.  We have also made the decision to very quickly move over to a token method of payment which obviates the need to have encrypted data on our servers, to give our customers further reassurance.  We would not ever wish to be the source of customer card information being compromised, so are making this change urgently. This work will take about a week, and we have removed the card details in their encrypted form, from our on- line system, and are removing the facility to update or provide card details until the work is complete.  Subscriptions will be processed daily each weekday morning under further supervised controls. Once the new system is in place, we will be able to collect payments through the token system.  We will also investigate the possibility of introducing PayPal as a form of payment as well, to offer our customers further choice.  What next  First we will start to process incoming and outgoing rentals. Then, once we are satisfied that our investigations are complete, we will bring our website back on line so existing customers can see their rental lists. We apologise for the inconvenience caused to our customers while this work is undertaken. Once everything is running again, we will be back in touch and will include updates at that time.  Finally, we would like to re-emphasise that we have not found any evidence of a breach in our systems (our systems were regularly tested for vulnerabilities by a 3rd party specialising in this) but our Engineers and Technical Advisors continue to investigate.  We are aware of the interest and concern this situation has raised and care about our customers and our reputation greatly and are urging our customers to get in touch with us immediately if they have any concerns.  We will shortly be sending an email directly to each of our customers.",

The list is still available elsewhere, reports PCPro.co.uk and Softpedia.  \"We have been able to download the list of usernames and passwords that were posted and are currently running checks to determine its veracity,\" Foxtons said in an email to MyFoxtons users.  Although the list doesn't contain financial information like credit card details, access to a user's MyFoxtons account could allow a person access to their home address and phone number.  Additionally, a hacker could gain access to MyFoxtons' features that allow landlords to electronically sign documents, manage the payments of rents online and see the deposit registration numbers of their tenants, according to this online demo.  It is not currently known who is behind the reported breach, or how they may have gained access to the data. The list is reportedly labelled \"Part 1\", potentially suggesting that more data is to come.  Foxtons declined to comment.",

    "summary": "Californian health plan administrator, Keenan & Associates, has announced a breach of Protected Health Information that has impacted 35,000 health plan subscribers.  An error was made by a vendor with the configuration of a web portal. The server security settings had been misconfigured resulting in a number of confidential documents being inadvertently indexed by search engines. A search of the Internet would have resulted in the documents being displayed in the search results. Clicking on the links would have opened up the documents and a number of data fields would have been viewable.  The data contained in the documents was mostly limited to personal information. Subscriber names, addresses, dates of birth, contact telephone numbers, health plan identifiers, and medical plan names were stored in the documents. Some Social Security numbers were also exposed, although Keenan & Assoc., reports that no financial information was detailed in the documents, neither any clinical or medical information.  An investigation into the data breach has not uncovered any evidence to suggest the files were actually viewed during the time they were accessible. However, this cannot be confirmed so there is a risk that data were viewed by a third party. In order for the documents to have appeared in a search, the search term entered would have needed to be quite specific.  The server settings have now been changed and the documents are no longer accessible via the Internet, and are no longer appearing in searches.  The breach notice issued by Keenan & Assoc., indicates the error was discovered on October 9, 2015; however, no information has been disclosed about the length of time the data were accessible.  All affected individuals have been provided with a range of services to monitor credit files and protect against identity theft and fraud for a period of two years. The breach victims are being covered by a $1 million identity theft protection policy, and in the event that health plan subscribers do suffer identity theft or fraud, services will be provided to restore credit and identities.  Since a wide range of personal information was exposed along with health plan identifiers, there is a possibility that an individual would be able to commit insurance fraud. As such, all breach victims have been advised to keep a close check on their Explanation of Benefits (EoB) statements to monitor for signs of fraudulent activity.",

    "summary": "Willis North America recently began notifying an undisclosed number of employees that their personal information may have been exposed when a health plan administrator mistakenly attached a spreadsheet containing sensitive data to an e-mail sent on March 19, 2014 to company employees who were enrolled in the Willis North America Medical Expense Benefit Plan's Healthy Rewards Program, to remind them of an upcoming deadline to earn wellness credits (h/t PHIprivacy.net).  The spreadsheet contained the affected employees' names, company e-mail addresses, birthdates, Social Security numbers, employee ID numbers, office locations, and internal administrative coding information.  \"The error was recognized within minutes, and the plan took immediate and extensive remedial action to try to avoid any misuse of information,\" Willis chief risk and compliance officer Ian Ullman wrote in a letter [PDF] to the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office. \"This included tracking and ensuring the deletion of any forwards of the e-mail, blocking the ability to forward the e-mail, and deleting the e-mail from recipient inboxes.\"  While the company believes that the data in the spreadsheet wasn't improperly accessed, and that all copies of the spreadsheet have been deleted, all current employees are being offered two free years of identity theft protection through TrustedID's IDEssentials service.  \"We have determined that this incident was not the result of an intentional or criminal act,\" Willis executive vice president Celia Brown wrote in the notification letter [PDF]. \"Rather, it was the result of an unfortunate and regrettable, but entirely honest, mistake.\"  ",

This is to inform you of an incident involving the inadvertent disclosure of information about you and your retirement plan. On December 3, 2013, a MassMutual retirement services account manager sent a secure email to an individual at a MassMutual retirement services client. However, the account manager inadvertently included information about you and your retirement plan in that message to the other MassMutual client. The individual who received the information in error was contacted by MassMutual and confirmed to MassMutual both verbally and in writing that the email and the information received in error was deleted. We have conducted an investigation into the incident to determine the extent and its impact on our customers. We have determined that the information provided to the other MassMutual client did contain personal identifying information, including your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and your retirement plan name and group number. MassMutual employees are instructed to safeguard client information. However, even after taking reasonable steps to protect confidential information, a security breach may occur. When we are informed of such situations, we investigate the matter and take appropriate corrective action. Based on the particular circumstances of this incident, we have no indication that your personal information has been or will be subject to misue or further disclosure. However, in an effort to provide you with additional protection for your personal and credit information, MassMutual has arranged with Equifax Personal Solutions to provide you with a free two year subscription for Equifax Credit WatchTM Gold with 3-in-1 Monitoring and Credit Report Control. A description of this product and enrollment instructions are enclosed. The promotion code to activate the product is located at the top of the enrollment instructions. Also, please note that this code is valid for 60 days. We would like to bring to your attention various steps you may want to consider taking to protect yourself against the possibility of identity theft.",

    "summary": "Highmark Inc. notified nearly 3,700 of its Medicare Advantage members that some of their personal and medical information may have been disclosed to others without authorization and in violation of federal law.  The state's largest health insurer said an error by a mailroom employee led to an unknown number of Security Blue and Freedom Blue members receiving the results of risk assessments belonging to others. The forms included member names, addresses, dates of birth, some medical information and their unique member identification numbers.  \"There is no evidence at all that any of the information that was mailed in error has been accessed or used inappropriately,\" the insurer said in a statement.  The mailings went out on April 19, and within days, Highmark heard from members who said they had received other people's forms.  Lisa Martinelli, chief privacy officer of the insurer's parent organization, Highmark Health, said the insurer spent the past month investigating how the error occurred before deciding to notify members. The risk assessment results were sent after Security Blue and Freedom Blue members replied to surveys intended to help them find resources to improve their health.  Medications being taken by members, scores on mood tests for depression and scores for frailty tests were among the medical information included on some of the risk assessments, Martinelli said. Social Security numbers were not on the forms, she said.  \"It is unlikely that anyone has done anything with this data,\" she said.  Under medical privacy rules included in the 1996 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, health insurers, hospitals and other medical providers are required to have policies and procedures in place to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of personal medical information. When a breach involving 500 or more people occurs, they must notify the Health and Human Services Department, which opens an investigation, along with local news organizations and those affected by the breach.  HHS spokeswoman Rachel Seeger declined to comment, citing a department policy not to comment on specific cases.  Highmark spokesman Leilyn Perri said the insurer on Thursday notified the department of the unauthorized disclosure.",

The health insurance organizations learned in early August that unauthorized access was gained to IT systems in late 2013, and personal information on about 10.5 million individuals may have been compromised.  An investigation conducted along with Mandiant revealed that names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, member identification numbers, financial account information and claims information, and in some cases clinical information could have been affected.  \"The investigation has not determined that any such data was removed from our systems,\" Excellus CEO Christopher Booth, wrote in a notification posted to the company's website. \"We also have no evidence to date that such data has been used inappropriately.\"  The incident affects about seven million members, patients and other individuals who have done business with a variety of Excellus BCBS plans. It also affects about 3.5 million members, patients and others who participate with Lifetime Benefit Solutions, Lifetime Care, Lifetime Health Medical Group, The MedAmerica Companies, and Univera.  Notification pages set up for each affected entity include additional details. All impacted individuals are being notified and offered two free years of identity theft protection and credit monitoring services.    \"We have moved quickly to close the vulnerability, remediate our IT systems and to strengthen and enhance the security of our IT systems moving forward,\" an FAQ posted to the Excellus BCBS website said, going on to add, \"Our data was encrypted, but the attackers gained unauthorized administrative access to our systems, therefore allowing them to potentially access personal information.\"  The investigation revealed that the initial attack occurred on Dec. 23, 2013. The FBI has been notified and is conducting an investigation.",

    "summary": " A company that guarantees federal student loans said Friday that personal data on about 3.3 million people nationwide has been stolen from its headquarters in Minnesota.  Educational Credit Management Corp. said the data included names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dates of birth of borrowers, but no financial or bank account information.  The data was on \"portable media\" that was stolen sometime last weekend, ECMC said in a statement. Company spokesman Paul Kelash wouldn't specify what was taken, citing the ongoing investigation, but said there were no indications of any misuse of the data.  The St. Paul-based nonprofit said it discovered the theft last Sunday and immediately contacted law enforcement, and made the theft public when it received permission from authorities. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is leading the investigation.  ECMC said it has arranged with credit protection agency Experian to provide affected borrowers with free credit monitoring and protection services. Borrowers will be receiving letters from ECMC soon on how to sign up, gain access to fraud resolution representatives, and be provided with identity theft insurance coverage.  \"We deeply regret that this incident occurred and the stress it has caused our borrowers and our partners and are doing everything we can to help protect our borrowers' identity and personal information,\" Richard Boyle, president and CEO of ECMC, said in the statement.  ECMC is a contractor for the U.S. Department of Education to provide collection and document management services. It guarantees student loans through the Federal Family Education Loan program, and provides support services for student loans that are in default or bankruptcy. The company can act as the guarantor, loan holder or loan servicer.  Department of Education spokesman Justin Hamilton said protecting student privacy is a top priority.  \"We are working with ECMC to make sure that affected individuals are provided with resources to protect their information and to provide with them with identity theft insurance,\" Hamilton said. said protecting student privacy is a top priority for the agency.",

Theyll get a letter telling them that their card was on that list and that we want to be a protective as we can be of their data, so theyll get a new card, Matt Stratton said, a spokesperson for TFCU.  He said thousands of Oklahomans will now be issued a new card and that will happen within two weeks of the letter.  Stratton said it is the best way to handle a breach like this, which this time came via a warning from a department store.  Stratton said TFCU moved to swiftly deal with the problem.  But that doesnt mean customers arent upset.  I mean, come on, you are supposed to keep peoples credit and important stuff secret, customer Greg Eggers said.  In the age of identity theft, that doesnt always happen.  The number of transactions by credit cards is growing and that does keep us very busy, Stratton said.  That means TFCU and other credit unions and banks across the country must stay vigilant.  TFCU said any affected customer who would like to close their account may do so immediately and that they hope any customers noticing unusual activity will report it.",

Janesville railroad engineer Joe Martin says he received a March statement that should have been sent to a Madison couple. Martin tells WISC-TV that he's concerned his statement ended up in the wrong hands.  Anchor Bank spokeswoman Jennifer Ranville says a mailroom malfunction is to blame for the problem. The statements included loan information, but did not include checking, saving or Social Security numbers. The Madison bank is offering one year of fraud protection to those affected. ",

Vahe Ruben Yerkanyan pleaded guilty to one count each of burglary, forging an access card and using personal information to obtain credit and was immediately sentenced to 270 days in custody and three years probation.  Yerkanyan was also ordered to pay a total of about $4,500 in restitution to six victims, according to the Riverside County District Attorney's Office. Under the plea deal, 13 other counts were dismissed.  When the man was busted on May 14, it was at a Palm Desert branch of  Chase where he \"was using stolen account information,\" according to police reports issued at the time.    Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. Steve DaSilva said that two days before the arrest was made, Yerkanyan went into a vestibule at the Chase branch at 78- 805 Highway 111 in La Quinta on three occasions, installing and removing a skimming device.  A security guard at the Palm Desert bank later alerted law enforcement that someone was trying to use stolen account information there, DaSilva said.",

    "summary": "According to local police, reports have been received relating to a possible card skimming device being used on the ATM at the Boorowa branch of the Bendigo Bank.  Senior Constable Randall Obrien warns the community to protect themselves by covering their PIN numbers when using any ATM.  The Bank has received several reports from customers relating to suspect withdrawals from accounts.   The matter is currently under investigation by the Banks Fraud section as well as police but it is understood that customers cards may have been compromised several weeks ago. Please check bank statements and records and if any possibly fraudulent transactions are observed, let the bank know immediately.   Police have indicated that the skimming device is no longer attached to the machine, and it is safe to use.  Bendigo Bank has released the following statement:  We believe a skimming device may have been placed on the Boorowa Bendigo Bank ATM in early June.  Our bank constantly monitors our customers accounts for suspicious activity, and we have been in contact with those who have had their security compromised.  We encourage all customers to regularly monitor their accounts and contact us if they see any unauthorised transactions.  Impacted customers will not experience any financial loss as a result of this skimming event.  We encourage our customers to take the following steps to protect themselves from skimming:  - Ensure nobody observes your PIN being entered into an ATM  - If you notice suspicious behaviour near an ATM, do not proceed with your transaction  - When using an ATM, cover the keypad when entering your PIN  - Keep an eye out for people looking over your shoulder  - Notify us immediately if your card or PIN has been lost, stolen or compromised  More advice is also available on our website www.bendigobank.com.au",

    "summary": "A well organized, sophisticated fraud ring is committing a crime that is becoming harder and harder to detect because of the technology they are using, according to Henry County Police.  ATM skimmers have been around for a long time but they are getting very hard for bank customers to detect. At one ATM in McDonough, 225 customers had their bank account information stolen, according to police.  So far, police have received reports from about 20 people whose accounts were breached. That leaves about 200 more who don't even know they're information was stolen. Lt. Joey Smith said the suspects haven't used their information yet, but probably will.  Lt. Smith said the suspects are using skimmers, electronic devices that are placed over the card slot on an ATM and when you put your card in, it scans your account information.  But Smith said they're also getting customers PIN's. \"They had some type of small, sophisticated camera that they could actually see you punch the PIN in on the key pad so they had the card information and the PIN information,\" he said.  Police released photos of several suspects using the stolen bank account information to withdraw cash from other ATM's in hopes that someone could identify them.  Authorities are seeking to identify these suspected ATM skimmersAuthorities are seeking to identify these suspected ATM skimmers (Photo: 11Alive) ATM photos from the Sun Trust bank on Highway 81 in McDonough show a man installing the skimmer on the banks ATM at about 7:00AM on August 1, 2014. Another photo shows a different suspect removing the skimmer at around 10:00PM.  Lt. Smith said anyone who used the Sun Trust ATM during those hours on that day should contact their bank and police.  The suspects have bank account information from every customer who used the ATM at that time. \"They would then take the electronic data, put it on another generic card, and they would go to various ATM's in Metro Atlanta and withdraw cash,\" Lt. Smith said.  Kristy Nix had her information stolen. She said she hardly ever uses an ATM but did on that day. She says she won't take a chance in the future. \"I'll go to my bank and write a check and do a cash option that way,\" she said.  The suspects used her bank account information to withdraw about $1,500. Even though her bank will eventually cover her loss, she says it hurts now. \"We have about 22 cents in the bank right now and I've had a bounced mortgage payment and two small kids at home,\" she said. \"We have to have money to get gas and go to work.\"  Police have advice for potential victims. \"Those customers who used this ATM during this time frame should check their accounts and notify Sun Trust bank,\" Lt. Smith said. \"They must also report any suspicious activity on their account to the police.\"  Lt. Smith said the suspects may not have used some of the stolen information yet so people should check their accounts every day. ",

Melik Torosyan, 31, and Khachatur Harutyunyan, 23, are charged with one felony count each of conspiracy to commit grand theft, possession of identifying information of 10 or more victims and acquisition of access card account information.  The two allegedly left the skimming device on an ATM at a Chase bank branch Saturday and returned later the same night to retrieve it, authorities said.  The device captured the financial information of at least 13 victims, according to prosecutors.  Undercover officers arrested the two as they left the bank's parking lot, according to Manhattan Beach police Officer Stephanie Martin.  Numerous items were seized during the investigation, including a credit card scanner skimming device, credit cards, gift cards, cell phones, mounting tape and a magnetic block to clear the magnetic strips on cards, police said.  According to police, the suspects installed the skimmer and a pin hole camera to cover the ATM's card slot. Account information, including the PIN numbers, were captured by the device, police said.  It was later discovered that the same suspects had placed similar devices on ATMs in Manhattan Beach at least six other times starting Jan. 30, officials said.  Torosyan and Harutyunyan are due back in court May 8, when a date is scheduled to be set for a hearing to determine if there is enough evidence to require them to stand trial.  --City News Service",

    "summary": "Facebook Inc has inadvertently exposed 6 million users' phone numbers and email addresses to unauthorized viewers over the past year, the world's largest social networking company disclosed late Friday.  Facebook blamed the data leaks, which began in 2012, on a technical glitch in its massive archive of contact information collected from its 1.1 billion users worldwide. As a result of the glitch, Facebook users who downloaded contact data for their list of friends obtained additional information that they were not supposed to have.  Facebook's security team was alerted to the bug last week and fixed it within 24 hours. But Facebook did not publicly acknowledge the bug until Friday afternoon, when it published an \"important message\" on its blog explaining the issue.  A Facebook spokesman said the delay was due to company procedure stipulating that regulators and affected users be notified before making a public announcement.  \"We currently have no evidence that this bug has been exploited maliciously and we have not received complaints from users or seen anomalous behavior on the tool or site to suggest wrongdoing,\" Facebook said on its blog.  While the privacy breach was limited, \"it's still something we're upset and embarrassed by, and we'll work doubly hard to make sure nothing like this happens again,\" it added.  The breach follows recent disclosures that several consumer Internet companies turned over troves of user data to a large-scale electronic surveillance program run by U.S. intelligence.  The companies include Facebook, Google Inc, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Yahoo Inc.  The companies, led by Facebook, successfully negotiated with the U.S. government last week to reveal the approximate number of user information requests that each company had received, including secret national security orders.

    "summary": "Disqus is updating its widely-used comments platform after a Swedish tabloid exposed politicians and other public figures for allegedly making highly offensive comments on right-wing websites.  The Swedish daily Expressen, working with an investigative journalism group, said it uncovered the identity of hundreds of people who left offensive comments at four right-wing websites through their email addresses. It then confronted the authors of the comments, many of whom freely admitted to writing them.   Later on Tuesday, Disqus said its network had not been breached and that it did not leak email addresses. The journalists appeared to have abused a feature it used for a third-party service, it said.  Also on CIO.com:  What CSOs should do on their first days Hiring an information security vendor? Use these best practices. Security takes center stage in 2016 Based on information from Disqus and other observers, a general picture of the journalists' method has emerged.  Disqus used a third-party service called Gravatar from Automattic, the company behind the WordPress software. Users can upload an avatar, which will then appear on any Gravatar-enabled website.  A Disqus API (application programming interface) fetched avatars from Gravatar using the hashed email addresses of registered users. A hash is a cryptographic representation of a value processed by an algorithm.  For example, the email address \"idg@idgnews.com\" when processed by the MD5 algorithm appears as this hash: \"0ff3eeab2b765f017a526bbddd328c3b.\"  The journalists likely collected the nicknames of commentators from the websites, then pinged Disqus' API to see what MD5 value was returned. They could have gained access to Disqus' API by creating an account, according to Eaxbreakparty, a blog run by a self-described cryptography enthusiast.",

The site is not government owned yet contains massive data, exposing login details of site users.  The hacker contacted me on Twitter and explained why the site was targeted, a similar explanation can be found on Pastebin where the data was dumped. The message can also read below:      The majority of the leaked accounts belong to Irani defacers.      The owner sucks for scanning his website with Acunetix to expose the vulnerabilities (This explains why there are emails like \u201cacunetix123@acunetix.com\u201d.      The passwords might work on the emails so make sure to login on each and every email for maximum lulz. =)  After analyzing the dumped data, I have found sites\u2019s database, site admin\u2019s emails with encrypted passwords, emails and encrypted passwords of thousands of Irani based defacers and site users, most of leaked emails are from @yahoo.com @gmail.com and @hotmail.com.  Link of targeted site and dumped data is available below:      http://append-hc.com     http://pastebin.com/x2LwWmzG  It seems the breach has massively affected the site as at the time of publishing this article, the website was down and displaying \u2018maintenance\u2019 message.

This matter now appears worse than originally suspected as the dataset also contains a table where RockYou have stored user credentials for social networks and other partner sites.  The database consists of a table containing partner data, and another table that has stored the credentials for those partner sites that users have entered.

    "summary": "Personal data on almost 4 million customers of Japanese telecom carrier KDDI Corp. has been breached, the company said Tuesday.  The data includes the name, address and telephone number of 3,996,789 people who had applied for accounts with KDDI's Dion Internet provider service up to Dec. 18, 2003, KDDI said. Additionally the gender, birthday and e-mail addresses of some of the people was also leaked.  KDDI is Japan's second-largest telecommunications carrier. It operates fixed-line, dial-up Internet, broadband and cellular services through a number of different companies.  The carrier became aware of the leak on May 31 this year when it received a phone call from someone claiming to possess a CD-ROM of the data, said Yoko Watanabe, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based carrier. The original source of the data has yet to be determined and Watanabe declined to comment on other aspects of the case, which is being investigated by the police, she said.  The leak is just the latest of several to hit the headlines in Japan this year. Personal information has been leaked by companies a number of times onto the Internet through viruses that infect PCs running file sharing programs. While the source of the data lost by KDDI is not yet clear, the episode is likely to increase fears of identity theft and other fraud in Japan.  In recent years the number of frauds committed against consumers using such information has been on the rise. Armed with the name and address or telephone number of a consumer, fraudsters can send out bills or make calls demanding payment for services that were never delivered. The slick frauds often dupe consumers into sending money before they realize they have been tricked.",

    "summary": "A group of alleged hackers has been charged with breaking into the computer systems of the U.S Army, Microsoft, and several other firms to steal pre-release copies of popular video games like Call of Duty, simulation software for Apache attack helicopter pilots, and confidential data that was used to create counterfeit versions of the Xbox gaming system, The Smoking Gun has learned.  Three men have been named in a sealed federal indictment charging them each with 15 felony counts, including conspiracy, fraud, and computer hacking, according to a copy of the 54-page document obtained by TSG.  Two other alleged hackers--a North Carolina resident and an Australian teenager--have been identified as unindicted coconspirators in the scheme, which began in early-2011 and continued for more than two years.  A federal grand jury last July returned a sealed indictment against Nathan Leroux, 19; Sanadodeh Nesheiwat, 28; and David Pokora, a Canadian resident. FBI agents last week arrested Leroux at his Wisconsin home and collared Nesheiwat (seen above) at his New Jersey residence. Pokoras status could not be determined.  It is unclear why FBI agents served arrest warrants eight months after the indictment was returned by a grand jury empaneled in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  According to the indictment, the trio and their coconspirators identified vulnerabilities and network weak points to illegally access computer systems at Microsoft and video game developers Valve Corporation, Activision Blizzard, Zombie Studios, and Epic Games. The hacks allowed the defendants to illegally obtain copies of various games that, at the time, were still in development, like Gears of War 3 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.  The Zombie Studios intrusion, prosecutors allege, allowed the hackers to then gain access to a U.S. Army server, from which Apache Helicopter Pilot simulation software entitled AH-64D Apache Simulator was taken. The Army had contracted with the Seattle-based Zombie to design the simulator software.  Investigators allege that the Microsoft hack resulted in the theft of Log-In Credentials, Trade Secrets, and Intellectual Property relating to its Xbox gaming system. At the time of the intrusions--which spanned 2011 and 2012--Microsoft was developing its Xbox One system, which was officially released in November 2013.  As a result of the Microsoft intrusions, Leroux (pictured at left) and the two coconspirators--armed with internal design and technical specifications and pre-release operating system software code--were able to build a counterfeit, next-generation Xbox console that was sold on eBay for about $5000, the indictment charges.  Leroux allegedly constructed a second counterfeit Xbox console with hardware components purchased from NewEgg.com. That system was destined for a purchaser in the Republic of Seychelles, a small island nation off the eastern coast of Africa.  The counterfeit console, however, was intercepted by the FBI with the assistance of an individual identified in the indictment as Person A, a Delaware resident who was cooperating with agents. Leroux had given the console to Person A, who was supposed to mail it to the Republic of Seychelles.  The indictment makes it clear that Person A had been involved with the hacking crew since mid-2011. For example, Person A and others participated in a July 2011 Skype conversation during which Pokora sought assistance with the installation of encryption software on his hard drives. I need your help. Im going to get arrested, Pokora said.  During an October 2011 chat session cited in the indictment, Pokora and the Australian teen--who is identified by his initials, D.W.--discussed  the illegal computer intrusions. if we do this right, we will make a million dollars each, said Pokora. In a Skype audio call, Pokora reportedly also spoke of compromising a fuckton of Paypals from compromised databases, adding that we could have already sold them for Bitcoins which would have been untraceable if we did it right. It could have already been easily an easy 50 grand.  Australian media have identified D.W. as Dylan Wheeler. The teens Perth home was raided last February, and he was subsequently charged in Childrens Court with an assortment of crimes. Wheeler is pictured above.   Using the handle SuperDaE, Wheeler provided confidential Microsoft documents to Kotaku, and told the web site of his various hacking exploits. The indictment refers to Kotaku quoting D.W. discussing his unauthorized access to a next-generation Xbox gaming console. The web site only referred to the teenager as Dylan. (6 pages)",

This incident was a result of a failure in a caching service that interfaces with devices using Exchange ActiveSync, including most smart phones. The failure caused these devices to receive an error and continuously try to connect to our service. This resulted in a flood of traffic that our services did not handle properly, with the effect that some customers were unable to access their Outlook.com email and unable to share their SkyDrive files via email. In order to stabilize the overall email service, we temporarily blocked access via Exchange ActiveSync. This allowed us to restore access to Outlook.com via the web and restore the sharing features of SkyDrive. These parts of the service were fully stabilized within a few hours of the initial incident. A significant backlog of Exchange ActiveSync requests accumulated as we worked to stabilize access. To avoid another flood of traffic, we needed to restore access to Exchange ActiveSync slowly, which meant that some customers remained impacted for a longer period of time.",

Some LogMeIn users began complaining of receiving malware spam to LogMeIn-specific email addresses on Dec. 3, 2012. The messages matched spam campaigns that spoofed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other organizations in a bid to trick recipients into opening a malicious attachment.  Multiple LogMeIn users reported receiving similar spam to addresses they had created specifically for their LogMeIn accounts and that had not been used for other purposes. The first LogMeIn user to report the suspicious activity said he received a malicious email made to look like it came from DocuSign but was sent to an address that was created exclusively for use with LogMeIn.",

    "summary": "German software developer Ashampoo has informed its 14 million customers that hackers gained access to its customer database in an embarrassing security breach.  The breach stings particularly for Ashampoo because it offers security software as part of its product portfolio.  Ashampoo chief executive Rolf Hilchner emailed customers and posted a message on the software vendors website after discovering that hackers had gained access to one of its servers.  Like many other companies, we are targeted by organisations of hackers that try to break into IT systems in order to steal data, he said. Unfortunately, one of our security systems fell victim to such an attack recently. An unauthorised access to one of our servers took place.  The company said billing information - including credit card and banking details  had not been compromised in the attack, as that data was stored on a separate system.  Hilchner nonetheless warned that hackers might attempt to use the customer information for financial gain. It could be combined with vulnerabilities in mail server systems of other companies, he said, in order to send alleged order confirmations in their name.  He cited a recent example of online retailer PurelyGadgets, which announced on Facebook that its servers were used to send bogus confirmations of orders. Hilchner said the emails contain a manipulated PDF document as an attachment that could be used to load malicious code upon execution.  Generally it is always important that you stay suspicious of unknown senders and that you do not respond to requests that tell you to open attachments, Hilchner said.  He advised customers not to open an attachment and delete any email that claimed to be a confirmation of an order from a company the customer cannot recall purchasing from.",

    "summary": "For more than two years, the Internet's most popular implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has contained a critical defect that allowed attackers to pluck passwords, authentication cookies, and other sensitive data out of the private server memory of websites. Ars was among the millions of sites using the OpenSSL library, and that means we too were bitten by this extraordinarily nasty bug.  By mid-morning Tuesday, Ars engineers already updated OpenSSL and revoked and replaced our site's old TLS certificate. That effectively plugged the hole created by the vulnerability. By installing the OpenSSL update, attackers could no longer siphon sensitive data out of our server memory. And although there's no evidence the private encryption key for Ars' previous TLS certificate was compromised, the replacement ensured no one could impersonate the site in the event hackers obtained the key.  With Ars servers fully updated, it's time to turn our attention to the next phase of recovery. In the hours immediately following the public disclosure of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability, several readers reported their Ars accounts were hijacked by people who exploited the bug and obtained other readers' account passwords. There's no way of knowing if compromises happened earlier than that. Ars has no evidence such hacks did occur, but two years is a long time. There's simply no way of ruling out the possibility.  It's for this reason that Ars strongly recommends all readers change their account passwords. A password change is especially urgent for people who logged in between Monday evening and mid morning on Tuesday. It's also particularly important for anyone who used their Ars password to protect accounts on other sites or anyone whose Ars accounts contained private messages of a sensitive nature. But again, out of an abundance of caution, Ars strongly urges all users to reset their pass codes.  As always, security-conscious readers should choose unique, randomly generated passwords at least nine characters long that contain upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. For a refresher on good password hygiene, see Ars senior IT reporter Jon Brodkin's The secret to online safety: Lies, random characters, and a password manager.",

The breach began on September 13 and was allowed to continue until January so that the hackers' behavior could be studied.

The breach came to light after 16 people were arrested following the theft of data from a number of online game and movie ticket sites.  The stolen records include real names, account names, passwords and resident registration numbers.  One of the 16 people detained, known simply as \"Kim\", is said by police to have obtained all 220 million records from a Chinese hacker he met through an online game in 2011.  Local authorities believe Kim then automatically logged in to the compromised online gaming accounts and stole game currency. He then allegedly exchanged that currency for real cash.",

The attack was launched from China's internet. After the incident, Auction.co.kr received a phone call offering to exchange the user information for money, the reports said.  According to a report on Dark Visitor, a security blog site, the Chinese hacker did not directly attack the server. The hacker sent out bulk emailings to the auction staff containing \u201chacker procedures\" that may have contained malware. When the staff members confirmed the emails, the hacker was able to gain their IDs. The hacker was then able to log into the Auction server using the staffer\u2019s ID.  The WASC report categorizes the exploit as a cross-site request forgery attack. \"The attack description is vague, but can be best described as session hijacking,\" the organization said. ",

    "summary": "alkTalk has revealed the impact of last year's data breach on its user base, confirming that it has lost 100,000 customers since its systems were hit.  Some 95,000 of those users were a direct result of the hack, which is estimated to have cost the operator around 60 million.  Breaking that sum down, IT support and customer response line costs amounted to between 40 million and 45 million, while trading losses accounted for the rest.  But TalkTalk's offer of a free upgrade to affected customers appears to have gone down well, with 489,000 accepting this method of apology.  No doubt this convinced some users to remain with TalkTalk and boosted customer confidence among those who stayed put.  That wasn't the only positive the company can draw from a difficult quarter, as revenues are up by 1.8% and its share price has also increased.  Metropolitan Police_ arrested a fourth suspect in connection with the TalkTalk data breach on Tuesday (November 3), apprehending a 16-year-old male in Norwich.  _  Prior to this latest development, men from Northern Ireland, London and Staffordshire were arrested in relation to the crime.__  While TalkTalk initially said that as many as 4 million customers could have been affected by a \"significant and sustained cyber-attack\", the company has since clarified that fewer than 1.2 million customer email addresses, names and phone numbers had actually been successfully breached.  On top of that, fewer than 28,000 obscured credit and debit card details and under 21,000 bank account numbers and sort codes were accessed, and TalkTalk maintains that the risk of fraud is minimal due to its encryption.  TalkTalk is expected to give evidence to the Committee to aid its investigation.",

But Zappos said that no credit or debit card information had been accessed by attackers.  \"We were recently the victim of a cyberattack by a criminal who gained access to parts of our internal network and systems through one of our servers in Kentucky. We are cooperating with law enforcement to undergo an exhaustive investigation,\" said Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh in an email that was sent to all Zappos employees Sunday, shortly before the company sent an email to its customers, warning them about the breach.   The stolen data, said Hsieh, may have included each customer's name, email address, billing and shipping address, the last four digits of their credit card number, and a \"cryptographically scrambled\" version of their website password. Such encryption, however, might not prevent attackers from eventually recovering passwords. Likewise, any customers who reused their Zappos password on another website that had suffered a breach would be at risk from attackers using that password to access their Zappos account. ",

    "summary": "On November 27, they reported to the the Maryland Attorney Generals office that a pharmacy employee had been accessing misusing customers credit card numbers. Eight Maryland residents were affected. Walgreens learned of the breach on November 4, terminated the employee, and referred the matter to law enforcement. The employee is being prosecuted.  You can read their notification to the state here (pdf).  Walgreens offered affected customers free credit monitoring services.  You can read their notification to customers here (pdf). They gave affected customers some good advice as to how to protect themselves. Their key points (and Im emphasizing some of the ones we dont see that often or often enough):  1. Monitor your insurance benefits. Ask your insurer for a listing of benefits paid out under your policy.  2. Check your prescription records. If you suspect youre a victim of medical ID fraud, get a copy of your records from your pharmacy.  3. Place an initial fraud alert on your credit reports.  4. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  5. Contact your Attorney General.  6. Correct inaccurate medical records. If you find errors in your medical files, have them corrected immediately. The federal law lets patients correct medical records created only by the medical provider or insurer that now maintains your information. You may need to contact all of your medical/health providers. If necessary, we will contact your insurance company on your behalf.   7. File a police report.  Good job on the notification, Walgreens!",

    "summary": "As looted prescription drugs flood Baltimore streets, fueling a surge in violence, pharmacy chain Rite Aid warned customers Wednesday that their personal medical information could be on the streets, too.  Store officials said the labels on prescriptions stolen during the late April riots included patient names, addresses and the names of medication, but not other sensitive data such as Social Security numbers or credit card numbers.  The alert nonetheless raised concern among privacy advocates who said the information could be used for fraud. Rite Aid has hired a risk management firm to help protect customers from identity theft.  The risk also extends to customers at looted pharmacies across the city. The Drug Enforcement Administration is reviewing surveillance footage from 27 pharmacies to possibly file charges against looters, and a spokesman said the agency would help monitor for any reports of medical identity fraud.  Depending on what information pharmacies include on prescription labels, criminals could improperly refill the prescriptions, bill medical care to the prescription holder's insurance or combine the information with other stolen data to commit larger acts of fraud, experts said. Medical data is gaining in value on black markets, prompting hackers to increasingly target health care organizations, such as CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the local insurer that last month revealed a data breach affecting more than 1 million customers.  \"It would not surprise me if patients who used those pharmacies that were looted later learned they were victims of medical identity fraud,\" said Ann Patterson, senior vice president and program director of the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance.  On Wednesday, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said police were working with federal partners such as the Drug Enforcement Administration to seize more than 175,000 \"units,\" or doses, of prescription drugs looted from 27 pharmacies and two methadone clinics when unrest erupted April 27, in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray from injuries sustained in police custody weeks earlier.  \"There's enough narcotics on the streets of Baltimore to keep it intoxicated for a year,\" Batts said. \"That amount of drugs has thrown off the balance on the streets of Baltimore.\"  DEA Special Agent Gary Tuggle said even more drugs have been stolen than reported. About 40 percent of the looted pharmacies have not finished counting losses, he said.  There is no evidence that personal information found on stolen prescriptions has been used for fraud, pharmacy and law enforcement officials said.  Still, Rite Aid officials said the chain has hired the risk management firm Kroll as a precaution \"to alert impacted customers via a letter of notification and share with them the proactive measures it has taken to guard against identity theft.\"  Federal law requires organizations bound by medical privacy laws, such as pharmacies, to disclose breaches of customer data. The organizations have 60 days to notify customers of such breaches, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.  Concerned Rite Aid customers can call Kroll at 1-855-294-2551 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., or Rite Aid at 1-800-RITE-AID.  A spokeswoman for CVS Health said that chain also would be notifying patients whose personal information might have been compromised and would \"let them know of steps they should take to protect against the misuse of their personal information.\"  Several CVS stores were looted, including one at Pennsylvania and North avenues that was set ablaze.  Peter Okojie, owner of two Care One pharmacies in Baltimore, said he had not heard any concerns over stolen information. Much of the drugs stolen from his pharmacies were later found on a school field, he said. Okojie said he was in communication with assisted-living facilities and other large customers about stolen drugs.  Even though prescription labels contain limited information, they still can be valuable to criminals, said Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. Having some personal information \"makes it a lot easier\" for criminals to commit fraud, allowing them to exploit data like prescription or insurance identification numbers, she said.  And that's not to mention general privacy concerns about medical conditions' being made public.  \"There's definitely a strong sense of violation any time people feel like their personal information is out there in someone's hands,\" Velasquez said.  Patterson recommended that customers of any of the looted pharmacies closely monitor any medical correspondence they receive, such as \"explanation of benefits\" documents that show what billings an insurer has received. She emphasized people should scrutinize claims made to their insurers under their names, a field that many often overlook because they don't suspect fraud, and watch for any letters from unfamiliar hospitals or other care providers.  \"As long as insurance pays for it, [people] don't really look at anything else,\" Patterson said.",

    "summary": "Credit card thieves are using a type of \"digital pickpocketing\" technology to steal credit card information from unsuspecting victims.  Technology has emerged in recent years that enables thieves to intercept credits card information with a simple swipe during a purchase. That information can be cloned to another card and used even as the original card remains securely inside its owner's purse or wallet.  Earlier this month, local authorities reported that more than 50 people, the majority from El Paso County, were victims of credit card skimming fraud. A multi-agency investigation was launched in April after members of ENT Federal Credit Union reported unauthorized purchases after visiting a 7-Eleven store in Monument.  The details of the technology used in the fraud were outlined in arrest warrants for three of the suspects identified in the case, including Geider Morales, who was arrested on suspicion of identity theft, money laundering, forgery, computer crimes and theft during in SWAT operation on July 1, authorities said.  In addition to the arrest, three skimming devices were recovered Colorado Springs police Detective Joshua Bliss in an email.  Police located one of the devices at a 7-Eleven at 3502 N. Academy Blvd.in April. Detectives and fraud investigators suspected another skimmer had been installed at the Shell gas station at 7805 N. Academy Blvd., although they didn't find anything.  Another device was found at a 7-Eleven on 624 Highway 105 in Monument, according to court documents.  Authorities tracked the fraudulent activities as far south as Pueblo and as far north as Denver. Suspects caught on camera used the rewritten or \"farmed\" cards at Chili's, Home Depot, and Walgreens.  Authorities reported that the theft amounted to more than $100,000.  The technology behind the fraud involves skimming devices that are covertly attached to a credit card reader, often inside of a gas pump.  The devices are designed to intercept credit card data as it's swiped through a reader. The information is stolen and loaded onto a memory chip capable of holding information from thousands of cards.  \"Skimmers are found anywhere you can use your credit card,\" Bliss said.  Not only can skimmers be put anywhere, Bliss said that they are virtually undetectable. They majority of them are purchased, he said, but they can also be made by the thieves.  \"You have to be aware of the internal setup of the device and know what you are looking for (to recognize it),\" he said. \"In other words, they are not too obvious.\"  That means the devices can often be installed and removed without ever being detected. And once the thieves have the information they want, they can rewrite it onto a blank or old credit card  It makes the victims of credit card skimming all the more unsuspecting.  In one victim's case, three $1,500 Home Depot cards were purchased with a card that had also been used to buy gas at the Shell station on North Academy Boulevard, according to court documents.  This type of crime is fairly new to Colorado Springs police. Since 2008, the police department has recovered two other skimmers, though neither was active when it was found.  \"Unfortunately, by the time that we are alerted to a potential compromised purchase point, the skimmer has already been removed,\" Bliss said. \"They were not presently in use, but had been used less than a day before we seized them.\"  Because of the complex nature of the current investigation and the capabilities of the devices, Bliss said there are likely many more skimming victims. And definitely more suspects.  There are two ways he says people can protecting themselves from this type of fraud.  \"Regarding the skimmers placed on gas pumps, you can pay inside the store, essentially bypassing the possible point of compromise, which is usually located inside the gas pump,\" he said. \"The best piece of advice is to check your account statements frequently for anomalies.\" ",

    "summary": "A lawsuit was filed against Schnucks Markets Inc. after customers learned that Schnucks failed to warn customers about a data breach within two weeks.  On March 15, Schnucks learned that a portion of their loyalty cards were affected, but waited until March 30 to send a press release.   Customer payment card numbers and expiration dates were exposed through a magnetic strip swiping security breach. No customer names were exposed.UPDATE (04/15/2013): The breach affected about 2.4 million customer debit and credit cards at 79 Schnucks locations.  Payment cardholders' contact and identifying information were not exposed.  Customers who visited a Schnucks between December of 2012 and March 29, 2013 may have been affected.UPDATE (05/24/2013): A class action lawsuit was filed against Schnuck Markets in early May.  Schnuck Markets claims that the the lawsuit belongs in federal court because of the case's scope and damages.  The lawsuit sought damages from Schnucks for time and effort that affected individuals had to put into monitoring and managing compromised credit card information.  The lawsuit also alleges Schnucks of willful and wanton neglect, a charge for which punitive damages are available under Illinois law.  However Schnucks states that the \"time and effort\" claims for Illinois alone easily exceed the $5 million threshold for federal consideration.UPDATE (06/21/2013): A new estimate from Schnucks states that 500,000 unique credit or debit cards may have been involved.UPDATE (07/11/2013): After a review, the Missouri Attorney General's office has stated that Schnuck Markets did not violate state data security law.",

Card skimming devices were found on machines at RS McColl in Frederick Street and Thomas Cook in Hanover Street in the city centre.  Anyone who used these machines should contact their bank and check their account immediately.  PC Steven Skirving, who is leading the investigations, said: These illegal devices are attached to cash machines and are used to copy a users bank card details, allowing a thief to come along later and use that information to steal from their account.  They are typically used for short periods of time, and it is good that we have been able to recover these devices and prevent further theft, however it is possible that innocent members of the public are at risk from having their accounts plundered.  \"Therefore I would urge anyone who used either of these cash machines to check their bank account, either at a branch or by telephone or online.  If anyone saw someone hanging about these machines, or apparently acting suspiciously, I would urge them to contact us so we can get their description.",

    "summary": "A Chinese engineer who worked in Waukesha for a subsidiary of GE Healthcare stole about 2.4 million files of trade secrets and other confidential company information and sent it to China, according to GE and the FBI.  Jun Xie, 41, who joined the medical equipment giant in 2008, had been suspended and hit with a civil suit by the company in July.  Then on Wednesday, just as that action appeared closed with Xie's agreement to an injunction ordering him to return what he could and cooperate with the company's investigation, he was charged in federal court with criminal theft of trade secrets and appeared in court.  The case is at least the second involving theft of sensitive technical data by a Chinese citizen working in the Milwaukee area. Last year, a cancer researcher at the Medical College of Wisconsin was charged with economic espionage before later pleading guilty to a lesser charge.  According to the criminal complaint, GE officials discovered in June that Xie had accessed and copied about 2.4 million files  about 1.4 gigabytes of data  from the company's secure network, starting in February 2013. Much of the information was of the type Xie was not authorized to use and was not necessary to his work writing source code for magnetic resonance technology.  The files included engineering designs, testing data, business strategy and source code for magnetic resonance systems. In court documents, GE said it would suffer \"irreparable harm\" if the trade secrets were disclosed.  Xie agreed to talk with FBI agents in June and said he began downloading GE's materials after his wife moved back to China from Waukesha early last year, and he realized he would return there, too, and would need to find work.  He told agents he downloaded lots of materials he knew were important to GE Healthcare, copied it to separate storage devices and sent them to his wife and brother in China.  Xie also said he planned to join a Chinese company that competes with GE in the MRI field but said he never gave the other firm the GE information and only intended to use it himself.  On Wednesday, the same day a federal magistrate judge in Milwaukee granted a permanent injunction to prevent Xie from obtaining any more GE information and ordering that he try to get back the storage devices he sent to China, he was arrested in Waukesha.  General Electric sued Xie in federal court in July, alleging claims of conversion, breach of contract, state and federal computer fraud, and violations of the trade secrets act.  GE asked for damages as well as court orders that Xie return all confidential, proprietary information to GE, cease accessing, copying or disclosing such information, and preserve all documents relative to his actions.  Xie has not retained an attorney, according to court records, but on his own agreed to cooperate with GE.  Xie joined GE Healthcare in 2008 as an engineer to write source code for GE's magnetic resonance technology. GE Healthcare is a major manufacturer of magnetic resonance imaging machines. The criminal complaint says he was in the U.S. under an H1B non-immigrant work visa and had been in the country since 2002.  Amanda Gintoft, a spokeswoman for GE Healthcare Systems, issued this statement late Thursday after an inquiry to the company's attorney in the civil suit:  \"GE considers theft of its intellectual property a very serious matter and will take all steps necessary to pursue those who engage in such acts. We will cooperate fully with the government in its criminal investigation but, as a company policy, GE does not comment on ongoing litigation.\" ",

    "summary": "Fitbit is facing a legal battle from competitor Jawbone regarding alleged employee poaching and data theft, according to a New York Times report.                          Jawbone claims Fitbit is \"systematically plundering\" proprietary data by hiring Fitbit staffers who allegedly stole confidential information prior to leaving their respective Jawbone jobs, according to the Times. The legal complaint, filed in California State Court, also says the eight-year-old company stole trade secrets and intellectual property.  The news comes not long after Fitbit filed for a $100 million IPO, as well as a report that says the fitness tracker maker may be losing its tight grip as the market leader given increased consumer demand for smartwatch devices. Argus Insights research claims the wearables maker is struggling and that its leadership in wearables is less than 50 percent, which is much less than its 68 percent ownership of the fitness band segment.   The alleged employee poaching and data theft has been going on since the start of the year, according to the Times report, which cites Jawbone's legal filing. Reportedly, Fitbit recruiters have reached out to nearly a third of Jawbone's workers. In addition, those hired on by Fitbit reportedly took Jawbone data, such as product information and business plans, on their way out the door.  The Times reports the court complaint includes details of actions by two employees who admit to taking confidential data from Jawbone's systems and that Fitbit's top human resources manager admitted her company was poaching workers. In its legal filing, Jawbone is asking for court action to stop the alleged poaching and financial damages relating to the alleged stolen data. ",

    "summary": "Already this year, there have been three episodes \u2013 look here, here and here. This latest, however, isn\u2019t due to a lapse in the drugmaker\u2019s systems, but can be traced to the company that provides cars to Pfizer employees, such as the sales reps. Last week, Wheels sent letters to about 1,800 Pfizer spouses and domestic partners saying there was a \u201ctemporary encryption error in the security system of a web site Wheels Inc was using to collect data.\u201d  As a result, personal info was \u201cbriefly transmitted over the Internet in an unsecured manner.\u201d What kind of info? Names, addresses, date of birth and driver\u2019s license numbers. The info was to have been used for background checks in order for spouses or domestic partners of Pfizer employees to be eligible to drive the leased company car, Stratford Dick, Wheels\u2019 marketing director told Pharmalot.  But he insists Wheels took \u201cimmediate steps to ensure that the data encryption was implemented appropriately.\u201d There was no breach of Wheels website, he adds, and there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that any of the unencrypted information was misused in any way. As a precautionary measure, the leasing company is offering two years of credit protection and credit restoration services free of charge. Whether that will please Pfizer employees remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Dick says a review of Wheels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data-collection systems has been conducted to ensure that this situation doesn\u2019t occur again. ",

The attackers have leaked email addresses, names, phone numbers and addresses allegedly stolen from the companys systems. Anonymous hackers claim the details belong to Pemex employees.  The attack on Plemex comes in light of numerous protests. Many Mexicans dont agree with the countrys president, who wants to privatize the company.

    "summary": "Man faces prison for computer-related fraud  Kate White Ricky Joe Mitchell told a federal judge he had found out he was going to be fired the night he shut down his former company's computer network and phone system for a month.   Mitchell, 34, pleaded guilty to one count of fraudulent activity connected with computers on Tuesday. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison when U.S. District Court Judge John Copenhaver sentences him April 24.  As a network engineer for EnerVest Operating, an oil and gas company with an office in Charleston, the indictment alleged Mitchell deleted backup information and transmitted a command to disable the data replication process, which is designed to transmit backup data to the company's Houston location.  \"Out of anger and being upset,\" Mitchell told the judge he sent the commands from his Hurricane home in June 2012. \"I expected it to actually be more of a window more so than hurting the entire company.\"  Mitchell said he only expected company employees wouldn't be able to log on to computers, access the Internet, or check e-mails for one day after he sent the command.   Instead, the company couldn't conduct business for a month, and lost $1 million because of Mitchell, according to the indictment. Mitchell, however, only admitted to causing the company to lose a \"substantial\" amount of money.  \"In 2014, it goes without saying that any business's electronic communication capabilities and data storage are nearly as important to its success as the product or service it provides,\" U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said in a statement. \"The prosecution of Mr. Mitchell for his reckless conduct underscores my commitment to help protect small businesses from any threat - both inside and out.\"  Mitchell, now living in Mableton, Ga., worked for EnerVest from August 2009 through June 26, 2012 - the date the computer system damage occurred.  He agreed to pay restitution, which Copenhaver will determine at a later date and also faces a fine of up to $250,000.  The plea agreement drops one count of recklessly damaging a protected computer. He could have faced a maximum of 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, Goodwin previously said.  Earlier Tuesday, Mitchell's attorney, public defender David Bungard, told Copenhaver his client was having second thoughts about his plea and asked for more time to meet with prosecutors.  Copenhaver gave Mitchell until 3 p.m., but said if an agreement hadn't been made by then, to be prepared for trial Monday.  When Mitchell was 17 and went by the nickname \"RickDogg\" online he was accused of attempting to plant viruses in the computer system at Capital High School. He was suspended and later forced to transfer schools, in a case that reached the West Virginia Supreme Court.  Mitchell told the judge Tuesday he had a bachelor's degree in computer science from West Virginia University Institute of Technology.  Copenhaver told Mitchell that a clerk would speak to him after the hearing about his financial standing. A magistrate judge had previously ordered Mitchell to make payments for his public defender, because he obviously had some assets, Copenhaver said, noting the order showed a 2013 and a 2014 BMW plus an \"upscale home\" Mitchell was making payments on.  In 1997, Mitchell graduated from East Bank High School, but not without a fight to be reinstated at Capital High that reached the Supreme Court.  The previous summer, he was suspended for three days from Capital for copying \"108 computer viruses from floppy diskettes to disk space allocated and assigned to another student on the Capital High School computer system,\" according to a memo to Kanawha County school board members, available in court documents from the earlier case.  The memo also states that Mitchell bragged about the incident and admitted it to school officials.  During the summer of 1996, according to the memo, Mitchell published derogatory statements about teachers and made threats to students he believed reported the virus.  He was given the option of transferring to South Charleston or East Bank to finish high school, but Mitchell wanted to keep taking Advanced Placement courses at Capital. His lawyer, Basil Legg, requested an injunction in Kanawha Circuit Court to let him remain at Capital.  Kanawha Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib decided an emergency injunction wasn't necessary and that Mitchell could wait for a hearing before Kanawha Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman. The state Supreme Court agreed with Zakaib.  In 1998, Kaufman dismissed the case, noting the matter was no longer relevant because Mitchell had graduated.",

The firm said its core business of oil production and exploration was not affected by the attack, which resulted in a decision to suspend Saudi Aramco's website for a period of a few days, presumably as a precaution. Corporate remote access services were also suspended as a result of the attack.  Oil and production systems were run off \"isolated network systems unaffected by the attack, which the firm has pledged to investigate. In the meantime, Saudi Aramco promised to improve the security of its network to guard against fresh assaults.  Saudi Aramco has restored all its main internal network services that were impacted on August 15, 2012, by a malicious virus that originated from external sources and affected about 30,000 workstations. The workstations have since been cleaned and restored to service. As a precaution, remote Internet access to online resources was restricted. Saudi Aramco employees returned to work August 25, 2012, following the Eid holidays, resuming normal business. The company confirmed that its primary enterprise systems of hydrocarbon exploration and production were unaffected as they operate on isolated network systems. Production plants were also fully operational as these control systems are also isolated.  A previously unknown group called Cutting Sword of Justice claimed responsibility for the attack, which affected three in four of the estimated 40,000 workstations used by the oil giant. The group said that it had hacked Saudi Aramco in retaliation against the Al-Saud regime for the \"crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world, especially in the neighboring countries such as Syria, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon [and] Egypt\".  The group said it hacked Aramco after compromising systems in \"several countries\" before implanting malware to \"destroy 30,000 computers\" within Aramco's network. The infected machines claim was made days before Saudi Aramco confirmed the same number of machines had been hit, lending credibility to the hacker group's claims.  Neither victim nor perpetrator named the malware that featured in the attack but security researchers implicated the Shamoon malware in the security breach (analysis by Seculert here). Shamoon, which emerged days before the assault, has both the capability to over-write data on infected machines and to destroy Master Boot Record files, thus making infected Windows machines impossible to boot.  Over-written files were reportedly replaced by an image of a burning US flag.  According to researchers, the malware also has the capacity to extract information from compromised before uploading it to the internet.  Core router names and admin passwords along with email address and supposed password of Saudi Aramco chief exec, Khalid A Al-Falih, were uploaded to Pastebin on Monday. The latest leak may be a result of the threatened follow-up attack, due to take place last weekend, rather than the fruits of the original malware-fuelled assault.  Rob Rachwald, director of security strategy at Imperva, described that Saudi Aramco attack as the first hacktivist-style assault to use malware.  \"In the past, hacktivists have typically used application or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks - in which they clog a website with traffic until it goes offline. However, the attack on Saudi Aramco is the first significant use of malware in a hacktivist attack. Hacktivists rarely use malware, if other hacktivists jump on this trend it could become very dangerous,\" he said.  A blog post by Imperva on the attack can be found here.  Similar data-wiping malware disrupted systems at Iranian oil exploration facilities in May in an attack that led researchers at Kaspersky Lab to the discovery of the Flame cyber-espionage tool. US gas prospecting firms have been hit by previous attacks, most of which are suspected to have been state-sponsored.  It seems wise to view claims that the Saudi Aramco assault was a case of politically motivated hacktivism with some skepticism, at least until a clearer picture of the previously unknown Cutting Sword of Justice group emerges. It could be the group is solely motivated at hitting back at Saudi's ruling royal family for the country's support in putting down Arab Spring-style revolts in other nations, such as Bahrain, but other motives are also possible.",

    "summary": "Hackers illegally accessed the Internet-connected controls of a New Jersey-based company's internal heating and air-conditioning system by exploiting a backdoor in a widely used piece of software, according to a recently published memo issued by the FBI.  The backdoor was contained in older versions of the Niagara AX Framework, which is used to remotely control boiler, heating, fire detection, and surveillance systems for the Pentagon, the FBI, the US Attorney's Office, and the Internal Revenue Service, among many others. The exploit gave hackers using multiple unauthorized US and international IP addresses access to a \"Graphical User Interface (GUI), which provided a floor plan layout of the office, with control fields and feedback for each office and shop area,\" according to the memo, which was issued in July. \"All areas of the office were clearly labeled with employee names or area names.\"  An IT contractor for the unnamed business told FBI agents the \"Niagara control box was directly connected to the Internet with no interposing firewall,\" according to the memo, which was published Saturday by Public Intelligence. The website has an established track record of posting authentic government documents. Barbara Woodruff, a spokeswoman in the Newark, New Jersey division of the FBI, where the memo originated, said the document appeared to be authentic.  The unauthorized access began in February, a few weeks after someone using the Twitter handle @ntisec posted comments indicating hackers were targeting SCADA\u2014or supervisory control and data acquisition\u2014systems. One tweet included a list of Internet addresses, including one that was assigned to the heating system belonging to the New Jersey business. The hack came five months before security researchers Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle blew the whistle on serious vulnerabilities in the Niagara system, which is marketed by Tridium, a company with US offices located in Richmond, Virginia.",
