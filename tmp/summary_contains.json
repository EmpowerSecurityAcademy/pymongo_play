    "summary": "The last of five people accused of tax refund fraud involving identity theft from medical records pleaded guilty Friday for his role in the scheme, U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer said.  Michael Ali Bryant, Sr., 41, of Lauderdale Lakes, faces up to 12 years in prison at his sentencing scheduled in April, prosecutors said.  A confidential informant approached Bryant to buy drugs through Bryants connection to a medical service provider. Bryant said he had no access to any drugs but he could sell medical records containing the personal information of hundreds of patients that could be used to file fraudulent income tax returns, according to court documents.  Bryant sold the source 10 pages with up to 25 names on each and gave specific instructions on how to file the tax returns online to get tax refunds in the patients names without their knowledge, the court records showed.  According to the complaint, Rosier worked for a company that performed medical laboratory tests where she had access to medical records with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (personal identity information or PII) of individuals in the course of her employment with that company. During the conspiracy, Rosier provided access to the companys database which allowed other coconspirators to steal PII from the company. Found on the computer of one of the coconspirators was the PII of over 1,300 individuals. Rosier knew that her co-conspirators would use the PII for fraudulent purposes. Moye also obtained information from the companys database, which he used to obtain credit cards and other identification in the name of a patient.",

An employee of Health Systems Management, which operates the clinic, reported that his work laptop was stolen, Dollard said.  The computer had a one-word password and was not encrypted, Emory said.  Although patient information was on the laptop, the information was very limited, the university said in an emailed statement.  \"There were no patient Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, financial credit card information, diagnosis or physician names in the laptop,\" Emory said.  Information on the laptop includes last names and first names for about half of the 826 patients, and the first initial for the remaining patients. The patients' dates of service and graphs of blood flow tests were also stored on the computer, the university said.  \"HSM has instituted process changes to protect against a similar event occurring in the future,\" the university said. \"Medical information stored on HSM laptops is required to be encrypted, as well as password-protected.\"  All of the patients whose information was on the laptop were notified by mail, Dollard said.",

She was sentenced to serve up to six months in a detention center, to serve 10 years on probation during which she can't work in the health care field and to pay a $12,500 fine.  The reasons she gave were vague. She told police she had personal issues that caused her to stop caring about her job, that she had fallen behind processing the piles of mammogram films that stacked up. So she went into the hospital's computer system, assumed the identities of physicians, and gave each patient a clear reading, an investigative report says. That allowed her to avoid the time-consuming paperwork required before the films are brought to a reading room for radiologists to examine, her lawyer Floyd Buford told the AP.  Her actions were uncovered in April 2010 after a patient who'd received a negative report had another mammogram three months later at another hospital that revealed she had breast cancer. As hospital staff began to investigate, it was determined that the doctor whose name was on the faulty report had not been at the hospital the day the report was filed. Rapraeger quickly confessed to her supervisor that she was responsible and was fired from her job about a week later, according to an investigator's report.",

    "summary": "The University of Pennsylvania Health System revealed Monday that some patients' privacy was accidentally breached because of misprinted bills.  One of Penn's billing vendors, RevSpring of Wixom, Mich., had a malfunction in its printing operation. As a result, some patients received bills containing both their own correct information and an unrelated patient's information on the reverse side of the statement.  The inadvertent information included the unrelated patient's name, physician, types of services and tests, and amount owed.  \"Social Security numbers, dates of birth, diagnoses, and insurance numbers were not printed on these\" misprinted bills, Penn said in a statement.  More than 500 erroneous statements, affecting more than 1,000 patients, were mailed, although Penn spokeswoman Susan E. Phillips said she did not have an exact number.  The vendor discovered and reported the problem to Penn on Dec. 5 and has since worked to investigate it, notify affected patients, and make sure the error does not recur, Phillips said.  \"We haven't had any angry patients,\" she added. \"Just people calling to say, 'Isn't this odd?' \"  Patients with questions about misprinted bills may call Penn's hotline at 877-309-0186.  The federal HIPAA law protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information, and requires businesses to provide notification following a breach.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has discretion to impose monetary penalties, depending on the nature and extent of the violation and the resulting harm. If the violation is unintentional and is corrected within 30 days, there are no penalties.",

But Bush had another activity on the side: identity theft.   \"Debra Bush started to utilize information that she obtained from her applicants, individuals that she was supposed to be hiring,\" said U.S. Postal Inspector Keith Moore.   As the contact person, Bush had access to each job applicant's personal information.   \"She had access to all of her applicants' information including Social Security number, date of birth, and all of their personal information,\" Moore said.   Bush also was targeting her Virginia patients.   \"She actually stole information from some of her hospice patients without their knowledge,\" Moore said.  Postal inspectors describe Bush as brazen.   \"She actually used people's personal identifiers to obtain utility services to her home, her power bill, her water bill, all that was in some of her victims' names,\" Moore said.  After executing a search warrant, inspectors sat down with Bush to discuss the allegations.   \"At that point she just started giving us one lie after another,\" Moore said.   Inspectors knew she was lying but couldn't get to her admit exactly why she committed her crimes.   \"She had enough money to pay her bills, to take care of her household,\" Moore said, \"but, unfortunately, she decided to use other people's information for nothing more than just as a hobby of sorts.\"   Could patients or job applicants have done something to protect themselves? Moore said it was unlikely.   \"In this situation, the company was very legitimate,\" he said. \"They had a great track record. Unfortunately, they just hired a person that, for whatever reason, want to steal.\"  Bush was sentenced to probation for her role in this scheme.",

We recently became aware of an incident that involves patients health information.  For affected patients whose contact information is available, we sent notice of this issue through the United States postal system. The purpose of this web notice is to alert affected patients that we were unable to contact by mail. If you did not receive a letter and believe this situation may apply to you, please call toll-free 1-877-215-3618, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and provide the following ten-digit reference number: 5897011714.  On November 26, 2013, Geisinger-Bloomsburg Hospital became aware that on an unknown date some protected health information (PHI) created and stored by the former Bloomsburg Hospital was unable to be located in an archive of laboratory records filed by year. The PHI, which is believed to have consisted of copies of specimen pathology reports and specimen blocks of tissue for procedures that patients may have had performed during calendar years 2006 and 2007, is presumed lost without documentation of proper destruction.  The information would typically include the patients name, medical record number, diagnostic description and impression of the tissue under review. No financial information, including social security numbers, was part of this protected PHI.  The Bloomsburg Hospitalwhich became part of Geisinger Health System on July 1, 2012, completed a thorough search to locate the missing records. In addition, we have properly secured the remaining records and undertaken a review of storage practices to confirm compliance with the law and Geisinger Health System policies and procedures.  At Geisinger, we take our responsibility to protect personal information seriously. We regret this incident, apologize for any inconvenience it may cause our patients, and remain dedicated to safeguarding patient information.  Sincerely, Lissa Bryan-Smith Chief Administrative Officer Geisinger-Bloomsburg Hospital  John Gildersleeve Privacy Officer Geisinger Health System  Geisinger-Bloomsburgh informed HHS that 3,101 patients were affected.

The health insurance organizations learned in early August that unauthorized access was gained to IT systems in late 2013, and personal information on about 10.5 million individuals may have been compromised.  An investigation conducted along with Mandiant revealed that names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, member identification numbers, financial account information and claims information, and in some cases clinical information could have been affected.  \"The investigation has not determined that any such data was removed from our systems,\" Excellus CEO Christopher Booth, wrote in a notification posted to the company's website. \"We also have no evidence to date that such data has been used inappropriately.\"  The incident affects about seven million members, patients and other individuals who have done business with a variety of Excellus BCBS plans. It also affects about 3.5 million members, patients and others who participate with Lifetime Benefit Solutions, Lifetime Care, Lifetime Health Medical Group, The MedAmerica Companies, and Univera.  Notification pages set up for each affected entity include additional details. All impacted individuals are being notified and offered two free years of identity theft protection and credit monitoring services.    \"We have moved quickly to close the vulnerability, remediate our IT systems and to strengthen and enhance the security of our IT systems moving forward,\" an FAQ posted to the Excellus BCBS website said, going on to add, \"Our data was encrypted, but the attackers gained unauthorized administrative access to our systems, therefore allowing them to potentially access personal information.\"  The investigation revealed that the initial attack occurred on Dec. 23, 2013. The FBI has been notified and is conducting an investigation.",

    "summary": "An emergency room doctor from St. Albert has been suspended for at least a month because she illegally tapped into restricted medical files. The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta announced this week that it had found Deanne Dee Gayle Watrich, an emergency room doctor and a St. Albert resident, to be guilty of unprofessional conduct. Watrich had previously admitted to unprofessional conduct at a hearing tribunal held by the college last November. Specifically, the tribunal wrote in its ruling, Watrich accessed the electronic health records of three people 21 times between Aug. 5, 2009, and May 2, 2010, without having a patient/physician relationship with those people. Its okay for doctors to access patient records if they are actually treating those patients, explained college spokesperson Kelly Eby, but not otherwise. She accessed the electronic health records of three people who she was not treating, she said. Its an invasion of privacy. It also violates the provincial Health Professions Act and Health Information Act, and goes against the Canadian Medical Associations Code of Ethics and the colleges standards of practice. Watrichs case started when the provincial privacy commission began investigating a complaint from a man who had requested an Alberta Netcare log. The log showed that nine doctors, none of whom were treating him, had accessed his electronic health records. He alleged that Watrich might be the one responsible. The man listed his partner and mother as co-complainants, both of whom had their files accessed by three other doctors. Watrich admitted to the privacy commissioner and to the tribunal that she was responsible for accessing these restricted records using the logins of 12 other doctors. On 21 occasions, the tribunal heard, Watrich used computers in the emergency department of the Edmonton Misericordia Hospital to access these records after the previous user had not logged out, and did so knowing that her personal ID would not show up in the computers logs as a result. Watrich was in a personal relationship with one of the complainants when she accessed some of the records, the tribunal found, and in a relationship with the former spouse of said complainant when she accessed others. I dont know why I logged in to their Netcare and why I did it so many times, Watrich said at the hearing last November. It didnt actually give me any power. It didn't give me anything. In retrospect, she believed accessing these records might have been a way for her to cope with the difficult divorce and child-custody proceedings her partner was going through at the time. Watrich told the tribunal that she was humiliated and embarrassed by her actions and deeply disappointed in (herself). She had apologized to the complainants, and paid a significant monetary settlement to them in a related lawsuit. Covenant Health (which runs the Misericordia) had also put a reprimand on her record. Even though Watrich didnt disclose any of the information she accessed, the tribunal ruled, her actions were done repeatedly and with intent to deceive, and impugned the reputation of her fellow physicians.",

    "summary": "On August 21, 2012, the 374th Medical Group (374 MDG) at Yokota AB, Japan, discovered a potential compromise of patients' protected health information (PHI) when, on or about September 22, 2011, a former 374 MDG provider mailed surgical reports he performed at the facility to his stateside address. These reports pertained to 438 patients and were intended for the American Board of Surgeons to maintain the provider's board certification. Unfortunately, the package containing the medical information never arrived at his home and the United States Postal Service was unable to locate the package. The data elements involved in the documents include patient names, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, diagnoses, descriptions and summaries of select procedures and operations performed by the provider between October 2007 and September 2011. Upon discovery, the 374 MDG immediately initiated an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the loss and identify those who were potentially impacted. To mitigate this incident and prevent future compromises of this nature, the 374 MDG is currently reviewing their policies and procedures to assist providers with the board certification process. ",

    "summary": "Perhaps some recent news about reality television show star Kim Kardashian can be viewed as beneficial to the public in that it could help spread the word on patient privacy problems across the country. Kardashian was among the patient whose records were accessed inappropriately at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles between June 18 and June 24. The Los Angeles Times reported that six workers were fired for the internal breach, but hopefully this case will help alert the public of ongoing health data security issues and spark conversation within the industry to reevaluate celebrity patient privacy procedures.  Kardashian gave birth on June 15 at Cedars-Sinai to North West (yes, thats her real name) and according to Reuters, the organization contacted her shortly after checking out of the hospital to alert her that her data had been breached. Exactly what patient information, such as medical or financial data, was viewed has yet to be reported.  Los Angeles healthcare organizations such as Cedars-Sinai often have to deal with high-profile patient records being targeted during internal breaches and this Cedars-Sinai case was no different, as five of the employees accessed a single patient record the other viewed 14 different records.  Cedars-Sinai said that three community physicians, Dr. Sam Bakshian, Dr. Abraham Ishaaya and Dr. Shamim Shakibai, violated hospital policy by offering their user names and passwords to employees, who then used the logins to access confidential patient records, including Kardashians. And according to a Cedars-Sinai statement, four of the six workers who logged onto the hospitals information system without permission to access patient records were local physicians employees that had hospital staff privileges. The others were a research assistant and volunteer.  David Blake, Cedars-Sinais chief privacy officer, said in a statement to the Times that the hospital has a high standard for security and that unauthorized access to any patients record is, quite simply, unacceptable.  Though theres a strong chance that employees werent trying to do much beyond look at the records in efforts to find Kardashians. But Cedars-Sinai was smart to act swiftly in firing all of the employees involved and banning them from accessing its patient data from another organization in the future. Healthcare organizations can only do so much to train employees and when they give out passwords to their underlings who arent supposed to have access, it makes their job to protect data even harder.  Other high-profile patient privacy breaches at Los Angeles healthcare organizations include data belonging to late actress Farrah Fawcett, Britney Spears and Maria Shriver being inappropriately accessed at UCLA Medical Center.",

    "summary": "One of the busiest medical clinics in Santa Fe has reported a security breach affecting patients who were treated at Santa Fe Family Health Center during two weeks in July. The clinic, 2801 Rodeo Road, released a statement Friday afternoon saying the breach occurred July 14 for patients who had office visits between June 30 and July 13. We are sorry to report to you that on July 14, Santa Fe Medical Group became aware of a breach to your personal health information, the company said in a statement. An unidentified man entered the clinic at about 3 a.m. July 14, according to the statement. There was a theft of voice-recorded files from the providers, as well as cash and checks taken from the safe of Santa Fe Family Health. No credit card information was stolen, the clinic said. The clinic is owned by Atrinea Health, a company founded by Dr. Philip Briggs, a physician who started practicing in Santa Fe and has since opened offices statewide. In addition to Santa Fe Family Health, Atrinea also owns Coraz_n Family Health on Rodeo Lane and clinics in Espaola, Los Alamos, Las Vegas, N.M., Albuquerque, Rio Rancho and Los Lunas. Santa Fe Family Health offers both urgent and primary care. No other clinics were affected, said Tammy Payne, medical records supervisor with Atrinea. She could not say if patients were notified before Friday, adding that the company is doing what it is required under federal laws. We had to do an investigation with regards to the information, Payne said. She said Atrinea was providing the press the same information as it was providing patients, and that she could not elaborate. In its statement, the company said it filed a police report July 14, initiated a forensics security investigation, changed locks as well as policies and procedures, and initiated operational or technology updates or changes triggered by the incident to improve confidentiality. Celina Espinoza, a Santa Fe Police Department spokeswoman, said the initial dispatch log from 1:46 p.m. July 14 indicates that deposits were stolen from the safe, it but does not refer to other items. I dont know if they made us aware there was personal information, she said. A full incident report was not available Friday. It is possible, Espinoza said, that further investigation by the company showed the possibility of identification theft and that is why the company was now alerting the public.

    "summary": "GP surgery bosses have apologised to parents after letters containing personal information about children were sent to the wrong addresses.  Bosses at the Latham House Medical Practice in Melton have apologised after up to 200 child flu vaccination consent forms were sent out to the wrong addresses.  These forms gave the child's name, date of birth, full address, registered GP and Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) number.  Latham House Medical Practice manager Alison Hipkin said she was not sure how many forms had been sent to the wrong addresses.  She said: \"We do not know if six, 16 or 60 or more forms went to the wrong addresses.  \"It was down to human error and we apologise to the parents concerned.\"  The error was spotted after parents in the town started receiving letters with consent forms containing details of other people's children.  Mum-of-five Kim Hendy, of Drummond Walk, Melton, said she received a letter about the flu vaccination on Saturday October 10.  She said: \"There was a standard letter about the consent form and another sheet of paper which was the consent form.  \"When I looked at the consent form it had the details of someone else's child on.  \"I could not believe it. Luckily I knew the other mum and was able to warn her.  \"What worries me most is who has got the details of my child and other children too.  \"There are lots of undesirable people out there. If this sort of information - the name of a child, their age, their address, gets into their hands, knows what might happen.  \"You read about children being snatched. it is very, very worrying.  \"They might apologise but I still do not know who got my child's personal information and what they have down with it.\"  A spokesperson for the practice said: \"It was brought to our attention this Monday that an administrative error occurred whilst sending out flu immunisation letters to a few households in Melton.  \" Invitation letters were sent to parents/guardians of children between the ages of two and four offering them a seasonal flu immunisation.  \"Whilst the letters have gone out to the correct patients, we have since been informed that the consent forms, in some instances, have been attached to the wrong letters.  \"This has been fully investigated and reported to the correct authorities.  \"The staff members have been informed of the error and all appropriate actions have been taken by the Practice to prevent a repeat of this incident.  \"The breach of confidentiality is regarding the child's name, address and date of birth. No medical information has been disclosed.  \"Any breach of data security will always be taken seriously by the Practice and we have mailed out apology letters to patients who might have been affected by this administrative error.\"  The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which upholds information rights, said no complaints about the Melton practice had been received.  An ICO spokesperson said: \"If people feel their information has not been processed in line with the law, they should take this up with the organisation in question.  \"If they are not satisfied with the response they receive they can contact us.\"",

The physicians' email accounts were exposed to malicious software in the mid-December security breach, health system spokesperson Charles Casey said. He said the doctors assumed the email came from the I-T department when they opened it but instead were phishing scams.  The emails contained patients' names, medical record numbers and limited information associated with a clinic or hospital visits. The emails did not list credit card or Social Security numbers.  The doctors first noticed the problem when emails disappeared from their accounts. Emails also were sent from their accounts to people outside of the health system, Casey said.  Some patients at UC Davis Medical Center said they were still concerned about the incident.  \"It's a little scary, still not good for the people who come here, \" UC Davis Medical Center visitor Luis Baron said.

The physician left the room to obtain or to fill out the form. The physician failed to logoff from his workstation which displayed a CPRS data from a patient that he had treated earlier. An X-ray for the earlier patient was also visible on a PACs workstation in the same room. When the physician returned to the room, the current patient made a declaration that she had taken a photograph of the x-ray and if the physician had not filled out the form for her, she would have reported the physician for a HIPAA violation. She then displayed her cell phone and deleted what she told the physician was a picture of the x-ray.",

The patient allegedly reports that the VA employee accessed her medical record to obtain her personal phone number. The VA employee's supervisor and Administrative Officer of that facility met with the patient to discuss the issue and the patient was offered the opportunity to file a formal complaint. There is currently an ongoing VA Police investigation of the allegation against this employee. The Information Security Officer (ISO) is conducting a sensitive access report (SAR) audit.  Incident Update\n01/19/12:\nThe VISN ISO was not able to perform a SAR as this medical record was not marked \"sensitive\" at the time the incident occurred. Since then, the medical record has been marked \"sensitive\" for future tracking. The VA employee has been placed on Authorized Absence until the investigation is completed by Human Resources (HR) and VA Police.\n02/02/12:\nPer the Chief of Police, the employee admitted to accessing the patient's record while he was not performing his official duties and obtaining her phone number. Therefore the patient will receive a letter offering credit protection services.\nResolution",

    "summary": "The Saskatchewan Health Ministry is writing to 58 West Nile virus patients about a potential breach of their private health information.  It happened during a health management class in 2005 and 2006 at the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology.  Up to 140 students in a health information management course were using information from West Nile patients that was on file from 2003.  West Nile fever, caused by the virus, typically comes with mild flu-like symptoms, but in rare cases can lead to paralysis or even death.  The information was aggregated, but there was a source file students had access to that contained the individual health records.  Officials say it's highly unlikely, although not impossible, that students actually read the names and associated health files.  In a news release, Sara Hawryluk, director of health information policy at the ministry of health, said the government is sorry and is working with the privacy commissioner to make sure nothing like this happens again.  The potential breach was discovered when SIAST sent the old records back for an update. At that time, the health ministry discovered what had happened.",

La Toya Yvette Tillman, 33, used her position at Gastroenterology Consultants in Hollywood to access the Memorial Healthcare System database through her computer at work to steal patient identities, including names, dates of birth, and social security numbers, so that she could sell them, according to court documents. Investigators say Tillman sold an individual approximately 2,000 identities for $1 each, and the individual told her that he used the identities to file fraudulent tax returns. In addition, in her car when she was arrested, Tillman had a list of 114 identities, including names, dates of birth, and social security numbers. Tillman pled guilty to one count of possessing fifteen or more unauthorized access devices with the intent to defraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. Sentencing is set for October 24th, 2014. Tillman faces up to ten years in prison for the access device charge, and a mandatory term of two years in prison, consecutive to any other term in prison, for the aggravated identity theft charge.",

The theft occurred during the weekend of Aug. 14. The patients who were informed had tests in the labs between Sept. 4, 2014, and Aug. 14. The hard drives included birthdates, names, diagnoses, types of procedures and other clinical notes. There were no Social Security numbers or addresses on the hard drives.  Because of the number of patients affected, Sentara is required by federal law to notify patients and the news media and to post a notice on the health system's website.  The theft led to new protocols. Portable hard drives are now secured in a locked drawer at all times.",

    "summary": "In July, Las Vegas-based Western Regional Center for Brain & Spine Surgery (WRCBSS) began notifying patients that their personal information  including Social Security numbers  might have been stolen by a former employee and used for fraudulent purposes.  How many victims? 12,000, according to HHS.gov.  What type of personal information? Names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and WRCBSS patient billing account numbers.  What happened? A former employee allegedly stole patient data and used it for fraudulent purposes, and is now the subject of a law enforcement investigation.  What was the response? WRCBSS is reviewing its internal policies and procedures, as well as its technology safeguards. All impacted individuals are being notified.  Details: WRCBSS was notified by law enforcement on May 13 of a breach of information related to its billing files. The former employee who is the subject of the investigation worked for WRCBSS in 2011 and 2012. HHS.gov lists the breach as having occurred from Nov. 28, 2011, to June 29, 2012.  Quote: Presently, we are unable to identify the specific patients whose personal health information was actually stolen nor do we know which of those patients whose information was stolen was also used for fraudulent activities, Robin Hasty, office administrator for WRCBSS, wrote in the notification to patients. We are therefore notifying all patients whose personal information was in our billing system at the time of the breach.

    "summary": " The New York City Health and Hospital Corp. (HHC) said that personal information of nearly 1.7 million hospital patients, staff, vendors, and contractors was stolen from a GRM Management Information Services van.  The data breach affected patients, staff, vendors and contractors at the Jacobi Medical Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, and their two affiliated health centers. The personal information was collected over the past 20 years and included names, addresses, social security numbers, patients medical histories, and the occupational/employee health information of staff, vendors, contractors, and others.  HHC stressed that the files are not readily accessible without highly specialized expertise and data-mining tools, and there is no evidence to indicate that the information has been accessed and misused. At the same time, HHC admitted that it did not know where the files are.  The loss of this data occurred through the negligence of a contracted firm that specializes in the secure transport and storage of sensitive data, but HHC is taking responsibility for providing information and credit monitoring services to any affected individual who may be worried about the possibility of identity theft, said HHC President Alan D. Aviles.  The 14-hospital system said it was providing free credit monitoring and fraud resolution services for one year to the nearly 1.7 million people affected. According to the Ponemon Institute, data breaches cost $204 per compromised record. That figure would place the cost of this data breach in the range of $350 million.  To recoup the cost, HHC said it was suing GRM Management Information Services to recover all of the costs associated with notifying all affected individuals, and to pay for other damages related to the loss of the data.  HHC said it reported the data breach to state and federal oversight, regulatory, and consumer protection agencies. Agencies notified include the New York State Attorney General, the New York State Office of Cyber Security, the New York State Consumer Protection Board, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and three nationwide consumer reporting agencies.",

    "summary": "Central Dermatology Center (Central) announced on November 7, 2014 that on September 25, 2014 it became aware that one of its servers had been compromised by malicious software (malware). Central immediately consulted with forensic IT experts to identify and remove the malware and determine exactly what information on the server may have been accessed. The malware was removed and the server has been disconnected from Centrals system.  The information on the server that may or may not have been accessed included patients name, address, phone numbers, date of birth, social security number, billing and diagnostic codes, insurance company, insurance co-payment information, healthcare provider, employer information, sex, treatment date, account balance, email address, and race.  Based on Centrals forensic investigation to date it is believed that patient bank account and payment card information were not compromised and electronic medical records were not on this server as they were encrypted by Central prior to the malware being placed on the server.  Taking aggressive action early and confronting this issue is consistent with the practices core value of behaving in an ethical and transparent fashion, said Greg Catt, Practice Administrator at Central Dermatology Center & Carolina Medi-Spa. Central hired a prominent forensics security expert firm and an information technology firm that investigated this incident, reviewed all systems, and Central has improved our security wherever necessary to help protect our community. On behalf of the people of Central Dermatology Center, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  As part of our investigation in this matter, we consulted with an IT forensics firm and a separate IT company who specialize in this area. The investigation revealed that malware compromised a password protected Central server on or about August 9, 2012 despite safeguards in place, including software on the server designed to prevent such malware. We contacted, and will continue to work with, local law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, North Carolina Attorney General, nationwide consumer reporting agencies, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regarding this matter.  Central is notifying potentially affected patients and patients are being offered free credit monitoring and identity theft protection.

Additionally, investigators said he stole patient information from emergency room data sheets that had been thrown in the trash back in August 2011. Memorial HealthCare says that none of the stolen patient records included medical data.  Parsons, Amber Sasha-Rashawn Simmons and Joshua Clayton Thomas then used the data to file online fraudulent 2011 tax returns for 10 former Memorial Healthcare patients and did $818,000 worth of damage. While the patient names weren\u2019t publicized, eerily enough, federal prosecutors did say that the data was stolen from both living and dead patients.

The patient that the medication actually belonged to was in the waiting area and after some time he came and questioned if his medication was ready.

    "summary": "As looted prescription drugs flood Baltimore streets, fueling a surge in violence, pharmacy chain Rite Aid warned customers Wednesday that their personal medical information could be on the streets, too.  Store officials said the labels on prescriptions stolen during the late April riots included patient names, addresses and the names of medication, but not other sensitive data such as Social Security numbers or credit card numbers.  The alert nonetheless raised concern among privacy advocates who said the information could be used for fraud. Rite Aid has hired a risk management firm to help protect customers from identity theft.  The risk also extends to customers at looted pharmacies across the city. The Drug Enforcement Administration is reviewing surveillance footage from 27 pharmacies to possibly file charges against looters, and a spokesman said the agency would help monitor for any reports of medical identity fraud.  Depending on what information pharmacies include on prescription labels, criminals could improperly refill the prescriptions, bill medical care to the prescription holder's insurance or combine the information with other stolen data to commit larger acts of fraud, experts said. Medical data is gaining in value on black markets, prompting hackers to increasingly target health care organizations, such as CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the local insurer that last month revealed a data breach affecting more than 1 million customers.  \"It would not surprise me if patients who used those pharmacies that were looted later learned they were victims of medical identity fraud,\" said Ann Patterson, senior vice president and program director of the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance.  On Wednesday, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said police were working with federal partners such as the Drug Enforcement Administration to seize more than 175,000 \"units,\" or doses, of prescription drugs looted from 27 pharmacies and two methadone clinics when unrest erupted April 27, in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray from injuries sustained in police custody weeks earlier.  \"There's enough narcotics on the streets of Baltimore to keep it intoxicated for a year,\" Batts said. \"That amount of drugs has thrown off the balance on the streets of Baltimore.\"  DEA Special Agent Gary Tuggle said even more drugs have been stolen than reported. About 40 percent of the looted pharmacies have not finished counting losses, he said.  There is no evidence that personal information found on stolen prescriptions has been used for fraud, pharmacy and law enforcement officials said.  Still, Rite Aid officials said the chain has hired the risk management firm Kroll as a precaution \"to alert impacted customers via a letter of notification and share with them the proactive measures it has taken to guard against identity theft.\"  Federal law requires organizations bound by medical privacy laws, such as pharmacies, to disclose breaches of customer data. The organizations have 60 days to notify customers of such breaches, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.  Concerned Rite Aid customers can call Kroll at 1-855-294-2551 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., or Rite Aid at 1-800-RITE-AID.  A spokeswoman for CVS Health said that chain also would be notifying patients whose personal information might have been compromised and would \"let them know of steps they should take to protect against the misuse of their personal information.\"  Several CVS stores were looted, including one at Pennsylvania and North avenues that was set ablaze.  Peter Okojie, owner of two Care One pharmacies in Baltimore, said he had not heard any concerns over stolen information. Much of the drugs stolen from his pharmacies were later found on a school field, he said. Okojie said he was in communication with assisted-living facilities and other large customers about stolen drugs.  Even though prescription labels contain limited information, they still can be valuable to criminals, said Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. Having some personal information \"makes it a lot easier\" for criminals to commit fraud, allowing them to exploit data like prescription or insurance identification numbers, she said.  And that's not to mention general privacy concerns about medical conditions' being made public.  \"There's definitely a strong sense of violation any time people feel like their personal information is out there in someone's hands,\" Velasquez said.  Patterson recommended that customers of any of the looted pharmacies closely monitor any medical correspondence they receive, such as \"explanation of benefits\" documents that show what billings an insurer has received. She emphasized people should scrutinize claims made to their insurers under their names, a field that many often overlook because they don't suspect fraud, and watch for any letters from unfamiliar hospitals or other care providers.  \"As long as insurance pays for it, [people] don't really look at anything else,\" Patterson said.",

    "summary": "Two biomedical device laptops were discovered missing on 05/20/14. VA Police were notified of the event. The two missing laptops were password protected but not encrypted due to being attached to biomedical devices. The laptops were located on mobile test stations in the Pulmonary Department. The portable test equipment was used when patients could not be transported to the Pulmonary Department for testing. The exact number of patients is unknown. The upper limit is 5,000 and could be as low as 350. The ticket will be updated when more information is available.  Update: The laptops were not encrypted as they were attached to biomedical devices. The laptops were VA issued equipment (EE#56243 and EE#56244). The Pulmonary supervisor reported that she discovered the laptops missing on 05/20/14 but was informed by one of the technicians that she saw them missing about 2 weeks ago, exact date unknown, but thought they were being worked on. The supervisor then checked with Information Resource Management Systems (IRMS) and Bio-med to see if they had been picked up the reply was negative. The laptops were last inventoried on 04/22/14 in room 6A-144. These were standalone systems and had never been connected to the network. To the best of the facility's knowledge, the laptops were not secured with cables and it is currently unknown why they were not secured. The facility is currently working on identifying the number of affected individuals (the number could be between 350 - 5000), as well as identifying the identity of the potentially affected individuals.",

Many people say their privacy has been violated and fear their houses may be robbed and their home growing gardens targeted.  Im outright panicked, said Multiple Sclerosis patient Suzi Berardini, who also suffers from trigeminal neuralgia. She said the mailman who dropped the letter off smirked when he handed her the envelope. Its terrifying. So many levels of terrifying.  Laurie MacEachern, who represents medical marijuana patients as director of the Medicinal Cannabis Patients Alliance of Canada Inc. said she is supremely concerned about the information being released to the public.  One patient said she got her mail and the delivery man said, I didnt know you smoked, said MacEachern.  MacEachern said previous letters did not have the word marijuana on it. Almost a dozen other medical marijuana patients called Metro with similar concerns. Most werent willing to comment on the record for fear of being exposed even more.  Health Canada Deputy Minister George Da Pont said the format of the mailing was the result of an administrative error. He said the letters outlining changes to the Marihuana Medical Access Program, which take effect next spring, were sent to 40,000 patients.  This is not standard Health Canada practice, he wrote in an email to Metro. On behalf of Health Canada, I deeply regret this administrative error. Health Canada is taking steps to ensure this does not happen again. Protection of personal information is of fundamental importance to Health Canada. We are in discussion with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.  Among the reasons for changes to the rules, which will prohibit patients from growing their own marijuana at home, cited in the letter is concern that participants in the program will be targets of home invasions.  A spokesperson with the office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner Heather Ormerod said in an email:  Our Office was not notified by Health Canada of this incident. We were made aware of it by a number of concerned individuals who contacted our Office. We have since received complaints and we will be investigating this matter, Omerod wrote. We have been in touch with Health Canada and are currently gathering further information.  Why people say they are upset: Suzi Beradini says she no longer feels safe in her Ottawa home after a letter from Health Canada exposed her as a medical marijuana patient.  Any Joe Blow who works at Canada Post now might know where I am and that Im a patient and can easily think, well, if shes a legal patient, she must have meds, she told Metro after receiving a letter.  I feel like a I have a giant bullseye on my roof.  Rick Gauthier is now considering moving from his small town in Quebec, as he says everybody likely knows he is a medical marijuana user after receiving his letter in the mail Thursday.  I think Im unsafe now.  He worries Canada Post workers may even steal his medicine.  Michael Greenblatts letter went through several hands before it was delivered to his room at a nursing home in Markham. When the letter finally reached his room, he said the delivery person said,  I would sure like to be in this program.   First of all, its my private medical issue, Greenblatt said. Its not up to Health Canada.  He has filed a complaint with Canadas privacy commission.",

    "summary": "PA health system reports 144-patient data, identity theft  In whats turned out to be a multi-layered case, 144 patients of Community Hospital in Chester and Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland, PA had their names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers stolen in an IRS tax fraud sting from January 2008 to September 2011. Rafael Henriquez Polanco, 30, and wife, Yanira Lopez, 27, according to delcotimes.com, allegedly filed fraudulent tax returns with fake W2 forms, sought $1.7 million in refunds and ended up with $257,710 in return money from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The couple had paid hospital employees to steal confidential medical forms and from there they would use those forms to steal patient identities. The couple is facing charges ranging from conspiracy to defraud the government, aggravated identity theft, passport fraud and presentation of an immigration application containing a false statement. The report also says that Lopez was charged with wire fraud and is looking at 52 years in prison if convicted while Polanco faces 32 years in jail if convicted. The U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Security Service, the Department of Labor, IRS Criminal Investigations, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations handled the case and charges. But one has to wonder whether the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plans on getting involved in the case to see if Crozer could have prevented the patient data theft. Polanco and Lopez were Crozer Keystone Health System and, according to philly.com, Crozer spokesman Grant Gegwich said two employees, non-professional employees of the hospital employees, have been terminated for their involvement. While there were no other details, Gegwich said procedures for handling and disposal of documents containing patient information have been modified. Considering that Gegwich said the hospitals were notified of the information theft in October 2011, will those modifications be sufficient if HHS or the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) comes knocking?",

    "summary": "University Urology, P.C. of Knoxville, Tenn. released a statement on April 11 that detailed how 1,144 patients data had been exposed in 2013 and early 2014.  Though the information was limited to patient names and addresses, University Urology said in statement posted on its website that Social Security Numbers, financial account information, clinical information were not exposed. According to the statement, an administrative assistant had gathered the data in efforts to sell it to a competing provider to help gain patient business. Patients began calling University Urology on February 13, 2014 to alert the organization that the competing provider had unexpectedly been soliciting their business.  We understand that any breach of protected health information is a concern for our patients. We sincerely regret this situation occurred, said Peggy Kares, HIPAA Security Officer at University Urology, P.C.  Following the breach, University Urology spoke with the breaching employee, terminated their employment, revoked their access to protected health information (PHI), changed internal passwords and agreed with the competing organization that received the patient information to destroy it. The organization added that employees would be retrained on patient privacy best practices.  University Urology, P.C. is notifying by mail the patients impacted by this breach. While it appears that the information subject to the breach was to be used for patient solicitation and there is absolutely no indication that the information may be used for purposes of identity theft, patients may choose to monitor their credit card, bank, or other financial statements for signs of fraud and identity theft. The level of culpability on the part of the competing provider in this breach is the most interesting part, considering it came to an agreement with University Urology. HealthITSecurity.com will post more details on the breach as they come out.",

It just didn't look right,\" Nguyen said.  The 33-year-old said he flagged down a Veterans Affairs employee, who called the Veteran Affairs police to get the files and take a report.  He hopes the issue is fully investigated and more oversight will be put in place.  \"I want whoever is the perpetrator... (to be) held accountable, not just slapped on the hand. I want them to actually sit there and say, 'Okay, this is serious stuff and this shouldn't be happening period,'\" Nguyen said.  Veterans Affairs officials said they were conducting an investigation to determine \"the contents of the documents, the circumstances surrounding the disposal, and what mitigation efforts can be enacted to protect our Veterans' personal information. Any breach of patient information is unacceptable and we will move aggressively to correct this issue,\" according to a statement.",

    "summary": "St. Elizabeths Medical Center said Friday it is notifying 6,831 patients that their billing information, including credit card numbers and security codes, may have been compromised when documents the hospital planned to shred were removed by a vendor from a building scheduled for demolition.  The papers did not include personal medical information and so far, there have been no reports that any of the billing data contained in the documents has been misused, according to hospital officials.  St. Elizabeths, in Bostons Brighton neighborhood, released a statement saying it was alerted Feb. 3 by an individual who reported finding papers from the hospital blowing through a field in Charlestown. They contained cashiers receipts for credit card payments made by five patients at St. Elizabeths surgical day center and other outpatient services.  While the individual reported seeing other papers but did not retrieve them, St. Elizabeths said representatives sent to the scene were unable to find any other documents. The hospital is owned by Boston-based Steward Health Care System, a chain of community hospitals.  St. Elizabeths Medical Center had hired certain trusted vendors to begin clearing out the building on Jan. 30, 2012, the hospital said in a statement. All materials containing either a patient name or personal information were supposed to have been shredded.   Hospital officials have no evidence that information for more than five patients was lost, but said they decided to alert all patients whose information had been stored in the office where the five patients records were kept. The receipts found included patients names, hospital account numbers, and credit card numbers, security codes, and expiration dates.  We take patients information very seriously, and were reviewing our policy, and our training procedures to make sure this never happens again, said hospital spokesman Chris Murphy.  The incident marked the second health care data breach in the region in recent weeks. On March 23, CVS Caremark Corp. said it had mistakenly sent letters to about 3,500 Tufts Health Plan members, giving them personal information about the medical conditions and medications of other members enrolled in a supplemental Medicare plan managed by Tufts.  That mistake was caused by an unspecified programming error by CVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefits manager for the Tufts Medicare Preferred Plan.",

    "summary": "ManagedMed Inc. (A Psychological Corporation), based in Los Angeles, recently notified the California Attorney Generals Office of a breach involving patient scheduling information.  According to their July 17th letter to patients, submitted to the state on July 25, some patient scheduling information located in their computerized system had been viewed via an unsecured webpage by two non-ManagedMed people.    ManagedMed learned of the breach on May 13 and launched an immediate investigation that revealed that from approximately March, 2013 through May 15, 2014, it was possible for unauthorized individuals to access the calendaring system in certain circumstances.  Seth Hirsch, PhD, President of ManagedMed, informed patients that An individual who knew the website address for the calendaring system could access patient scheduling information for the period between November 1, 2010 through May 15, 2014. In addition, with respect to a limited number of patients, it was possible for an unauthorized person to access the ManagedMed calendaring system by performing a Google search of a patients name and then clicking on a link to the calendaring system website.  Information in the calendaring system included patients names,  telephone numbers, names of care providers, limited notes, and the date of the appointment. In certain cases, Dr. Hirsch wrote, the notes contain abbreviations about the general type of visit scheduled, for example f/u (follow up),  i/e (initial examination) or notes about medication or a test the patient was scheduled to take.  Considering that this is a mental health facility, exposure of such information could be somewhat embarrassing or problematic.  No Social Security numbers or drivers license numbers were accessible via the calendaring system and it was not possible to access patients actual medical records, which are not maintained on a computer, Dr. Hirsch explained.  The calendaring system was secured on May 15, and other than the two individuals who accessed it without authorization on May 13, ManagedMed is not aware of any other access to the system or any misuse of information.  No services were offered to the patients and they were given no advice. ManagedMed did apologize for the incident and reassure patients that the system was now secured.  You can read the notification here (pdf).  And no, this incident is not (yet?) up on HHSs public breach tool. Im wondering what they might do in this case as exposing information about patients at a mental health facility is pretty serious, even if only two people actually accessed the information.  Note: ManagedMed Inc. does business as Managed Med, Inc.",

He took notes on his smart phone and then read the patient_s name, DOB, the date of his last C&P exam to the health information management (HIMS) supervisor and told her that the patient was right handed. He stated he was brought into the room by the nurse who then left him alone with an unsecure computer with patient information on it. The HIMS supervisor made him delete the patient_s information off of his phone in front of her.",

    "summary": "The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), which operates the Metropolitan Hospital Center (Metro- politan), values the importance of protecting the confidentiality of our patients' medical records. Therefore, we regret to inform you of an incident that resulted in the possible unauthorized disclosure of your protected health information (PHI), including such information as your name, medical record number, medical diagnosis, physician's name, and limited sensitive medical information. Although we have no evidence that your PHI was inappropriately used, we are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to inform you of this incident in writing. We also want to assist you by providing you with the steps that you can take to protect yourself from any harm that may result from this incident. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: By way of background, HHC has implemented an information governance and security program that, among other things, monitors and detects all email communications that contain PHI and other confidential information that are sent outside of HHC's information systems without proper authorization. The incident in question, which occurred on January 15, 2015, was discovered on March 31, 2015 when, in the course of HHC's monitoring of outgoing emails, we identified an email that contained PHI, including yours, which a Metropolitan employee improperly sent from his HHC email account to his personal email account. While there is no indication that the employee improperly used the information contained in the email, its transmission was unauthorized and certainly not condoned by Metropolitan. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident and advising you of the actions that we have taken and the ones that we recommend you consider taking to protect yourself from any possible adverse effects that could arise as a result of this incident. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE BREACH: Metropolitan has promptly taken a number of steps in response to this incident. First, we interviewed the responsible Metropolitan employee and examined his HHC email account to ensure that we identified all the sites to which the email and spreadsheets were sent. We also reviewed the employee's personal email account, and were present to ensure that the employee deleted the email and spreadsheets from his personal email account. Second, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity theft protection at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.",

    "summary": "On November 27, they reported to the the Maryland Attorney Generals office that a pharmacy employee had been accessing misusing customers credit card numbers. Eight Maryland residents were affected. Walgreens learned of the breach on November 4, terminated the employee, and referred the matter to law enforcement. The employee is being prosecuted.  You can read their notification to the state here (pdf).  Walgreens offered affected customers free credit monitoring services.  You can read their notification to customers here (pdf). They gave affected customers some good advice as to how to protect themselves. Their key points (and Im emphasizing some of the ones we dont see that often or often enough):  1. Monitor your insurance benefits. Ask your insurer for a listing of benefits paid out under your policy.  2. Check your prescription records. If you suspect youre a victim of medical ID fraud, get a copy of your records from your pharmacy.  3. Place an initial fraud alert on your credit reports.  4. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  5. Contact your Attorney General.  6. Correct inaccurate medical records. If you find errors in your medical files, have them corrected immediately. The federal law lets patients correct medical records created only by the medical provider or insurer that now maintains your information. You may need to contact all of your medical/health providers. If necessary, we will contact your insurance company on your behalf.   7. File a police report.  Good job on the notification, Walgreens!",

    "summary": "Stanley Hill was dropping off some personal items at the York County Solid Waste Authority incinerator Memorial Day weekend when he noticed bundles of documents strewn across the ground and filling a nearby dumpster.  The Shrewsbury Township resident stopped to pick one up and found a stack of personal medical records from a local doctor's office.  \"It shocked me,\" he said. \"Who would think it's OK to dump them there?\"  Hill said he had worked for Johns Hopkins University where he spent some time implementing HIPAA regulations in computer software. He immediately felt he had to protect the files.  He wanted to alert the public, so he gathered up records from the ground  47 files  and gave them to the York Daily Record.  \"I wasn't sure what to do at first,\" he said. \"I didn't know if I should take them to the police. I finally thought, this is what news agencies are for.\"  The York Daily Record contacted the Pennsylvania Department of State, which then asked for the files. The Daily Record gave them to an investigator. The department will review the documents as the first step in an investigation, according to Ron Ruman, press secretary with the state.  It is not known who delivered the local medical records found at the authority's dumpster, or how they got there.  The files bear the names of the York Academy of Surgery and Dr. R. Dale McCormick.  They contain personal medical information, doctors' notes, social security numbers and insurance information.  Some of the surgeries occurred at Memorial Hospital, according to the records. But a hospital spokesman said the records did not belong to Memorial.  Jason McSherry, community relations and marketing spokesman at the hospital, said York Academy of Surgery was a private practice.  \"It is normal practice for hospitals to securely share patient records related to care provided by the hospital with independent physicians on the medical staff to support the delivery of care to their patients,\" McSherry said. \"Once records have been provided to physicians, it is their responsibility to dispose of those records in a secure manner.\"  Ruman said McCormick has an active osteopathic medical license.  Calls made to the practice on Eastern Boulevard in Springettsbury Township rang unanswered, and the office appeared vacant. Neighbors said they didn't know the last time they'd seen someone there.  Other attempts to locate the doctor or the practice were unsuccessful.  Rachel Seeger with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which handles HIPAA regulations, said it was the first they had heard of the incident and were unable to comment.  Ruman said he could not recall similar cases. Most of the cases the Department of State deals with involve patients who want access to paperwork after an office has closed.  According to the Health and Human Services website, medical officers \"are not permitted to simply abandon\" patient information or \"dispose of it in dumpsters or other containers that are accessible by the public or other unauthorized persons. However, the Privacy and Security Rules do not require a particular disposal method.\"  Doctors are told to review their own policies and determine what steps are \"reasonable to safeguard\" patients.  The only time they may be dumped in trash receptacles is if the size of the files requires they be put in locked dumpsters accessible only to authorized people, according to the website.  Ruman added that the state requires offices to keep medical records for seven years, and that doctors are responsible for protecting patient information, but that the state does not regulate how the records must be destroyed.  Ellen O'Connor with the York County Solid Waste Authority said the area where Hill found the files is a public disposal location. The incinerator is on Blackbridge Road in Manchester Township.  Anyone can go there to dump waste, but O'Connor found it odd that someone \"would choose that level to get rid of documents.\"  The waste authority has a confidential destruction program with most medical offices. In those cases, a representative from the office brings the files and either tosses them in the incinerator themselves, or watches someone do it, and then gets a certificate of their destruction.  By the time O'Connor was contacted for this story June 9, anything in those dumpsters would have been destroyed, and cleaning crews would have picked up debris on the ground, she said.",

Then I realized the press release was from a UHS-Pruitt affiliate, UniHealth SOURCE, and it was reporting a second breach that also involved a laptop theft.  The December 6th  press release (pdf) reads, in part:  UniHealth SOURCE, a provider of case management services in the Georgia Service Options Using Resources in a Community Environment (SOURCE) Medicaid waiver program, is committed to our clients privacy and compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations. The purpose of this notice is to identify a recent incident involving the theft of a computer laptop belonging to one of our employees. The laptop contained very limited information about current and former clients: specifically, the first and last name and, in some cases, potential diagnoses. The laptop did not contain any other identifying information, such as Social Security numbers or dates of birth, which could be used by an identity thief to financially exploit our clients. Although the laptop did contain the names of approximately 4,500 current and former clients of UniHealth SOURCE, UniHealth Select, and Blue Ridge Community Based Services, the level of financial risk to these individuals appears to be very low.  On October 8, 2013, the employees laptop was stolen from her car at her home. The theft was reported to the police, and we continue to cooperate fully with the investigation. The computer laptop was used by the employee to access and maintain certain patient information for the purpose of quality assurance audits for health care services provided by the above-referenced offices. Upon discovery of the theft, all access through the employees stolen laptop to computer applications, such as electronic medical records, was cut off immediately. Nevertheless, we determined that the above-described patient information was stored locally on the computers hard drive. We have not received any indication that such information stored on the computer has been accessed.",

    "summary": "A former lab worker at the Veterans Hospital in Madison used information stolen from VA records, from mail stolen from her neighbors and information purchased on the Internet to obtain credit cards and access other people's checking accounts, according to criminal charges filed this week.  Elizabeth Feng, 23, of Madison, was charged Thursday with 17 counts of identity theft, two counts of misdemeanor theft and two counts of unauthorized opening of mail in the scheme, which began to unravel on May 30 when her boyfriend tried to make a legitimate payment on some parking tickets at the Madison Police Department.  Police have issued a warrant for Feng, who was also a UW-Madison student at the time.  According to a criminal complaint filed Thursday, the boyfriend went to pay parking tickets after his car had been impounded, only to be told that he had to pay in cash because fraudulent payments had been made for tickets on his car in the past.  Police staff had found that the earlier citations were paid using the checking account information of people who lived in New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut and Mississippi, and that one of those people had contacted police about the fraud, the complaint states.  The man told police the earlier payments had been made by his girlfriend, Feng, the complaint states.  According to the complaint:   Contacted by police, Feng at first admitted to using a \"random person's account\" a couple of times, from information she found on a website. But pressed further, she admitted taking mail belonging to other people in her apartment building in the 400 block of West Dayton Street, not cashing personal checks sent to her neighbors but using account number and bank routing information on them to pay her boyfriend's parking tickets online.  Among the items taken from Feng's neighbors' mail were also packages of goods such as a wine opener, clothing and a cutting board and knife. Feng said she threw most of that stuff away. In her apartment, police found opened mail and boxes addressed to other people. Feng opened six credit card accounts using information for five patients stolen from the VA Hospital, where she worked. She had mail for the accounts addressed to the apartment of one of her neighbors, who told police he was shocked when informed that there were 16 credit cards in 14 names associated with his address. The man said that when he received mail that wasn't addressed to him, he would drop it on the floor by the mailboxes.  Police also found a large number of Capital One credit cards in Feng's apartment and found the names on them matched a list of 15 names and Social Security numbers that police found on a document located on Feng's computer.  Two of VA Hospital patients had since died. The son of one of those men told police that on the day of his father's funeral, his mother received a phone call from Capital One asking if his father had recently opened a credit card with them.  Feng had worked as a medical assistant in the hospital's pathology and lab department. She left her job on May 31. The hospital's lab manager told police that Feng would have had access to patient information including birth dates and Social Security numbers.",

    "summary": "When you go to the hospital you expect your private health information to be kept private.  But 2 NEWS Investigates uncovered a lawsuit by two local women that alleges they repeatedly had the privacy of their health information violated by employees at Kettering Health Network, also known as Kettering Adventist Healthcare.  Every time you see a new doctor you probably sign a notice of privacy practices. Its part of a national law called HIPAA.  Its meant to keep things like your visits to the doctor and even your billing information from getting into the wrong hands.  But Kettering Health Network and its former employee are being sued accused of not following that law.  Vicki Sheldon and her daughter Haley say they feel violated.  I dont know if I could feel anymore violated then if I had just been stripped down naked and walked in front of every executive in Kettering, said Vicki.  They claim Kettering Health Network employees wrongfully accessed their health information.  Vicki said Kettering first alerted her to the violation. According to Vicki, Kettering told her that her ex-husband, Duane Sheldon who worked in the Administration Department at Kettering, had inappropriately looked at her records.  I received some reports directly from Kettering, from their system. Quite frankly when I got them I was very disturbed by the number of people who had no reason to be in my records had been in my records apparently just whenever they felt like looking.  Vicki said that report showed her records were looked at again and again for 15 months by people who she says had nothing to do with her care.  Both women believe Kettering Health Network did not have the appropriate procedures in place to protect their private records.  Theyre suing both Kettering Health Network and Duane Sheldon for invasion of privacy and negligence.  Duane Sheldons attorney told me hes declining an interview but provided a brief statement that says in part, much of the Plaintiffs Complaint is inaccurate and personally inflammatory.  According to his attorney, Duane Sheldon no longer works for Kettering Health Network.  Kettering declined to comment directly about the lawsuit.  But regardless of the legal side of things, 2 NEWS Investigates wanted to know how safe your information really is and if there was in fact a breach at a health network that serves thousands of people in the Miami Valley.  The Director of Compliance Program, Megan Brickner who oversees patient protection agreed to answer questions.  Natalie: Was there a HIPAA violation at this network by employees?  Brickner: I cannot comment to that in particular, but I can say again we have this Protect program that we are continuously looking at the risk landscape and if we see something we need to address then we do so,  Brickner said not every employee has access to every part of a patients record. The access they get is based on their job title.  She also said Kettering has a system in place that notifies them if a patients record was accessed by the wrong person.  There are reports that get ran. We also have a third party come in every year looking at our IT infrastructure, she said.  Brickner wouldnt go into detail about the types of reports that are run or disclose the latest results of them.  But she does say if your records were looked at inappropriately its required by law to let you know.  Natalie: Should patients be worried about their medical information?  Brickner: To be honest with you, I think everyone needs to always be vigilant. I think its very important to be your own advocate.  Natalie: Are you running those reports and is everything working?  Brickner: Yes. Everything is working. I will tell you how well its working. We do have a commitment to protecting patient privacy and securing their information.  Vicki said those answers are not enough.  I would hate for anybody to have to go through this. Its humiliating. Its degrading. It takes away your power, said Vicki Sheldon.  According to public court documents Duane Sheldon and Kettering are asking that the lawsuit be dismissed, arguing that individuals cant sue over HIPAA violations.  2 NEWS Investigates went to the top legal expert in the state to find out.  My understanding of the law is that individuals do not have the right to sue under the HIPAA law but what they could do is file under a tort law of common law that exists in every state and file an action under that, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.  DeWine said a states attorney general and the US Department of Health and Human Services are the ones who can take legal action when someone believes their health information was violated.  Vicki and Haleys attorney said the government is overburdened and this case is about more than HIPAA violations. Its about an invasion of privacy.  Its a new and emerging area of the law therefore in Ohio, this type of breach doesnt have a lot of case law behind it, but there are other states notably Indiana and California where theres been significant privacy violations, said Vicki and Haleys attorney, Rob Croskery.  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, you have the right to see and get a copy of your health records and who has looked at them. All you need to do is ask your hospital for them. In most cases they have up to 30 days to provide the copy.",

    "summary": "Nazanien Ebrahimi, a/k/a Nancy Ebrahimi, 32, of Fairfax County, Virginia, was indicted by a federal grand jury on February 26, 2015, on charges of wire fraud, health care fraud, aggravated identity theft, and making false statements relating to health care matters. Dana J. Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; and Andrew G. McCabe, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBIs Washington Field Office, made the announcement after Ebrahimis initial appearance today in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson. If convicted, Ebrahimi faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each wire fraud count, 10 years in prison on each health care fraud count, a mandatory two-year consecutive sentence for each of the aggravated identity theft counts, and five years in prison on each count of making a false claim regarding health care matters. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Criminal indictments are only charges and not evidence of guilt. A defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty. According to allegations in the indictment, Ebrahimi, a law school graduate, owned and controlled Dental Arts Group, which purported to provide administrative and consulting services to dental practices. Through her control of Dental Arts Group, Ebrahimi allegedly carried out a scheme to steal the identities of various individuals, including other dentists, and use their identities without their knowledge to open merchant accounts with consumer dental financing programs, including CareCredit. To gain access to these programs, Ebrahimi submitted false and misleading enrollment applications. Once the fraudulent CareCredit merchant accounts were opened, Ebrahimi allegedly billed patients for charges that were inflated, never authorized, or never approved. For example, under one CareCredit merchant account that Ebrahimi opened without the victims knowledge, patients disputed nearly 50 percent of the total amount Ebrahimi charged for purported dental services. At the time, the dispute rate for all other CareCredit dental merchants was less than 1 percent. Furthermore, Ebrahimi allegedly submitted false CareCredit charge slips that purported to bear the signatures of patients. The indictment further alleges that Ebrahimi defrauded Humana, a private health insurer, by submitting false and inflated insurance claims for dental services that were never rendered. Ebrahimi allegedly deposited the profits earned from her scheme in various bank accounts that she controlled. Finally, the indictment alleges that Ebrahimi manufactured, or attempted to manufacture, and destroy various patient records. This case is being investigated by the FBIs Washington Field Office. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Lowell and Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye are prosecuting the case.

Its warning comes following four data breaches at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust which saw letters containing sensitive information about the treatment of five patients being sent to the wrong addresses.  The breaches happened between January 2012 and June 2013, with three of the instances caused by temporary staff who despite being involved with the handling of private information, hadn't received proper data protection training. \"This time of year often coincides with a rise in the number of temporary workers being employed across the UK,\" said ICO enforcement group manager, Sally Anne Poole. \"However, the temporary nature of their employment doesn't absolve employers of their legal responsibilities for making sure people's information is being looked after correctly,\" she continued. \"If organisations are employing temporary or agency workers into positions that involve the handling and sending out of personal information then they must make sure these staff have received adequate data protection training,\" Poole said. She added that Great Ormond Street is now required to ensure it improves its data protection standards. \"Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust failed to do this and have now been required to sign an undertaking with our office to improve their practices,\" Poole concluded ",

    "summary": "Back in February 2013, we learned of a horrific privacy breach in which a gynecologist had been secretly recording his female patients.  His conduct had been reported to the hospital by a female co-worker and he was fired. The files were found in his home after he committed suicide. In March of 2013, some of his patients filed a potential class action lawsuit.  Today, Justin Fenton of the Baltimore Sun reports that Johns Hopkins Hospital has reached a proposed settlement for a lawsuit filed last fall. The settlement involves $190million.  As Fenton notes, the settlement, if approved, might be the largest of its kind:  The settlement may be the largest of its kind. A class-action suit involving a Delaware pediatrician convicted of recording assaults on hundreds of children led to a $120 million settlement in 2012. That same year, a Connecticut hospital settled for about $50 million with 150 victims of an endocrinologist who used a medical study as a pretense to take obscene photographs of children.  []  In court papers, plaintiffs also contended that Levy engaged in doctor-patient boundary violations during the course of his patients treatment, including an excessive number of unnecessary pelvic exams and engaging in inappropriate physical contact. Some said Levy practiced without medical professionals on hand as observers, a routine hospital practice for the safety of patients and doctors.  Hopkins said it had identified more than 12,500 potential victims.  Read more on Baltimore Sun. Associated Press provides additional coverage.  Somewhat surprisingly, this incident does not seem to be recorded at all in HHSs public breach tool. Its therefore possible that OCR is still investigating this incident and that Johns Hopkins could be facing other consequences apart from the lawsuit.",

    "summary": "  Complete Medical Homecare didnt encrypt emails sent to trusted business partners like All American Medical Supplies. That failure to encrypt, combined with human error, resulted in a regrettable privacy breach.  On December 27, CMH discovered that materials with patients names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and certain medical diagnoses had been transmitted to AAMS on December 12. AAMS then used that information, in error, to send introductory letters to the patients and, in some cases, they sent them medical equipment.  When CMH discovered their error, they contacted AAMS, who destroyed their copy of the data, and agreed that no further letters would be sent out. Patients who received equipment from AAMS were asked to contact them to arrange for the return of the equipment at no cost to them.  Because CMH and AAMS are both covered by HIPAA, this breach was not as bad as it might have been, although clearly it was an unintended disclosure of PHI that patients needed to be informed about.  As part of preventing future incidents of this kind, CMH is undertaking a number of steps, including deploying encryption when emailing outside the company. Actually, they should have been doing that anyway, as even though they may trust the recipient, failure to encrypt allows capture or interception of the communications by attackers.  You can read CMHs report to the New Hampshire Attorney Generals Office and their notification to three New Hampshire residents here (pdf).  The total number of patients notified was not reported.  Update: The breach also affected 16 Maryland residents, but we still dont know the total number affected. ",

    "summary": "The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) has found Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in breach of the Data Protection Act after sensitive information was sent to the wrong address.  The information was disclosed when eight letters about patients were sent to one of the people affected in July 2013. The letters should have been sent to a GPs surgery. Six of the letters included sensitive medical information relating to the patients treatment.  An ICO investigation found that the employee responsible for the mistake hadnt received any form of data protection training. While the health board had introduced mandatory data protection training for all staff in April 2013, by February 2014 only 6.5% of staff had received it. The health board informed the ICO that it did not anticipate providing the training to all of their staff until April 2015.  ICO Assistant Commissioner for Wales, Anne Jones, said:  We accept mistakes can happen, but organisations must make sure employees handling sensitive personal information are given the necessary training to carry out their role. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board failed to do this.  The health board has now signed an undertaking committing the organisation to improving the training provided to its employees. This includes prioritising staff who manage sensitive information as part of their core role, or who work in a lead information governance role within the organisation by ensuring theyve received data protection training by 30 September 2014. The health board will also make sure their staff complete refresher training every two years.  These improvements will significantly reduce the risks of a future breach occurring and help to keep patients information secure.\" ",

Some patients' Social Security numbers were exposed, as were medical record numbers, health plan ID numbers, beneficiary numbers, medical information, full face photographs and state license numbers: A Smorgasbord of data that could potentially be used by criminals to commit medical, insurance and identity fraud.  Silverberg discovered the security breach on August 28, 2015, and immediately launched an investigation. That investigation revealed the device had posted data online since September 10, 2013. The company has now secured the device and data and has enlisted the help of a specialist data security firm to conduct a forensic data analysis to determine whether data was accessed during that time frame.  The matter has also been reported to various law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, and government and state authorities have also been notified of the security breach. Affected individuals have now been notified by mail, and are being offered a year of credit monitoring services, along with identity theft protection and identity restoration services through Kroll.

According to the provider of health services, attacker(s) hacked into a server and accessed patient and employee data files from St. Joseph Regional Health Center, Burleson St. Joseph Health Center, Madison St. Joseph Health Center, Grimes St. Joseph Health Center and St. Joseph Rehabilitation Center.  The data accessible to attackers included a combination of names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and possibly addresses, the organization said. For the affected patients, medical information was also accessible, and for some employees, bank account information was exposed.  The attackers appeared to be operating from IP addresses in China and elsewhere, the organization said.  As soon as the incident was discovered, SJHS took the affected server offline and launched a thorough forensics investigation with national security and computer forensics experts, a statement explained. The investigation, which is ongoing, confirmed that approximately 405,000 former and current patients', employees' and some employees' beneficiaries' information was accessible to the unauthorized parties.  While it is possible that some information was taken, the forensics investigation has been unable to confirm this, the statement continued. SJHS does not believe any of our former/current patients', employees' or their beneficiaries' information is at further risk because of this incident.  Affected individuals whose information was accessible are receiving notification letters by mail in the coming days providing them information on this incident.  For individuals who may have been affected by the incident, SJHS said it would provide a confidential call center to handle questions related to the breach, along with free identity protection services for one year for affected patients and employees.",

And a tiny minority \u2014 a handful in the history of nursing \u2014 turn medicines into a murder weapon.  One such nurse was Charles Cullen, who is the subject of my book The Good Nurse. A former Navy electronics technician who used his technical acumen to enable his crimes and avoid detection, Cullen got away with medical murder in at least nine hospitals over the course of his 16-year career. (He was finally arrested in 2003; he\u2019s currently serving life in Trenton Maximum Security Prison.)   Cullen was the master of a new machine that hospitals started using to track and distribute drugs, a computerized cabinet called a Pyxis MedStation. Manufactured by an Ohio company called Cardinal Health, the machine is essentially a metal drug cash register with a computer screen and keyboard affixed to the top.Cullen had realized that if he placed an order of the drug for his own patient, then quickly canceled it, the drug drawer popped open anyway. He could simply take what he wanted without recording it in the system. It was that easy.",
