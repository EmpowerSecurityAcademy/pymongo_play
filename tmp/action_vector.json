A confidential informant approached Bryant to buy drugs through Bryants connection to a medical service provider. Bryant said he had no access to any drugs but he could sell medical records containing the personal information of hundreds of patients that could be used to file fraudulent income tax returns, according to court documents.  Bryant sold the source 10 pages with up to 25 names on each and gave specific instructions on how to file the tax returns online to get tax refunds in the patients names without their knowledge, the court records showed.  According to the complaint, Rosier worked for a company that performed medical laboratory tests where she had access to medical records with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (personal identity information or PII) of individuals in the course of her employment with that company.

Jun Xie, 41, who joined the medical equipment giant in 2008, had been suspended and hit with a civil suit by the company in July.  Then on Wednesday, just as that action appeared closed with Xie's agreement to an injunction ordering him to return what he could and cooperate with the company's investigation, he was charged in federal court with criminal theft of trade secrets and appeared in court.  The case is at least the second involving theft of sensitive technical data by a Chinese citizen working in the Milwaukee area. Last year, a cancer researcher at the Medical College of Wisconsin was charged with economic espionage before later pleading guilty to a lesser charge.  According to the criminal complaint, GE officials discovered in June that Xie had accessed and copied about 2.4 million files  about 1.4 gigabytes of data  from the company's secure network, starting in February 2013. Much of the information was of the type Xie was not authorized to use and was not necessary to his work writing source code for magnetic resonance technology.  The files included engineering designs, testing data, business strategy and source code for magnetic resonance systems. In court documents, GE said it would suffer \\\"irreparable harm\\\" if the trade secrets were disclosed.  Xie agreed to talk with FBI agents in June and said he began downloading GE's materials after his wife moved back to China from Waukesha early last year, and he realized he would return there, too, and would need to find work.  He told agents he downloaded lots of materials he knew were important to GE Healthcare, copied it to separate storage devices and sent them to his wife and brother in China.  Xie also said he planned to join a Chinese company that competes with GE in the MRI field but said he never gave the other firm the GE information and only intended to use it himself.  On Wednesday, the same day a federal magistrate judge in Milwaukee granted a permanent injunction to prevent Xie from obtaining any more GE information and ordering that he try to get back the storage devices he sent to China, he was arrested in Waukesha.  General Electric sued Xie in federal court in July, alleging claims of conversion, breach of contract, state and federal computer fraud, and violations of the trade secrets act.  GE asked for damages as well as court orders that Xie return all confidential, proprietary information to GE, cease accessing, copying or disclosing such information, and preserve all documents relative to his actions.  Xie has not retained an attorney, according to court records, but on his own agreed to cooperate with GE.  Xie joined GE Healthcare in 2008 as an engineer to write source code for GE's magnetic resonance technology. GE Healthcare is a major manufacturer of magnetic resonance imaging machines. The criminal complaint says he was in the U.S. under an H1B non-immigrant work visa and had been in the country since 2002.  Amanda Gintoft, a spokeswoman for GE Healthcare Systems, issued this statement late Thursday after an inquiry to the company's attorney in the civil suit:  \\\"GE considers theft of its intellectual property a very serious matter and will take all steps necessary to pursue those who engage in such acts. We will cooperate fully with the government in its criminal investigation but, as a company policy, GE does not comment on ongoing litigation.\\\" \", \"action\": {\"misuse\": {\"vector\": [\"LAN access\"], \"variety\": [\"Privilege abuse\"]}}, \"security_incident\": \"Confirmed\", \"plus\": {\"github\": \"4348\", \"analysis_status\": \"First pass\", \"created\": \"2014-09-29T16:19:00Z\", \"attribute\": {\"confidentiality\": {\"credit_monitoring\": \"U\", \"data_misuse\": \"Y\"}}, \"modified\": \"2014-09-29T16:19:00Z\", \"timeline\": {\"notification\": {\"month\": 9, \"year\": 2014}}, \"master_id\": \"234DF890-29E8-421D-A69F-062701170D54\", \"analyst\": \"swidup\"}, \"asset\": {\"assets\": [{\"variety\": \"Unknown\"}], \"governance\": [\"Unknown\"]}, \"victim\": {\"victim_id\": \"GE Healthcare\", \"country\": [\"US\"], \"region\": [\"019021\"], \"state\": \"WI\", \"employee_count\": \"101 to 1000\", \"industry\": \"424990\"}, \"timeline\": {\"incident\": {\"month\": 6, \"year\": 2014}}, \"source_id\": \"vcdb\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"57a21d240be444284201f836\"}, \"schema_version\": \"1.3\"}",

The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta announced this week that it had found Deanne Dee Gayle Watrich, an emergency room doctor and a St. Albert resident, to be guilty of unprofessional conduct. Watrich had previously admitted to unprofessional conduct at a hearing tribunal held by the college last November. Specifically, the tribunal wrote in its ruling, Watrich accessed the electronic health records of three people 21 times between Aug. 5, 2009, and May 2, 2010, without having a patient/physician relationship with those people. Its okay for doctors to access patient records if they are actually treating those patients, explained college spokesperson Kelly Eby, but not otherwise. She accessed the electronic health records of three people who she was not treating, she said. Its an invasion of privacy. It also violates the provincial Health Professions Act and Health Information Act, and goes against the Canadian Medical Associations Code of Ethics and the colleges standards of practice. Watrichs case started when the provincial privacy commission began investigating a complaint from a man who had requested an Alberta Netcare log. The log showed that nine doctors, none of whom were treating him, had accessed his electronic health records. He alleged that Watrich might be the one responsible. The man listed his partner and mother as co-complainants, both of whom had their files accessed by three other doctors. Watrich admitted to the privacy commissioner and to the tribunal that she was responsible for accessing these restricted records using the logins of 12 other doctors. On 21 occasions, the tribunal heard, Watrich used computers in the emergency department of the Edmonton Misericordia Hospital to access these records after the previous user had not logged out, and did so knowing that her personal ID would not show up in the computers logs as a result. Watrich was in a personal relationship with one of the complainants when she accessed some of the records, the tribunal found, and in a relationship with the former spouse of said complainant when she accessed others. I dont know why I logged in to their Netcare and why I did it so many times, Watrich said at the hearing last November. It didnt actually give me any power. It didn't give me anything. In retrospect, she believed accessing these records might have been a way for her to cope with the difficult divorce and child-custody proceedings her partner was going through at the time. Watrich told the tribunal that she was humiliated and embarrassed by her actions and deeply disappointed in (herself). She had apologized to the complainants, and paid a significant monetary settlement to them in a related lawsuit. Covenant Health (which runs the Misericordia) had also put a reprimand on her record. Even though Watrich didnt disclose any of the information she accessed, the tribunal ruled, her actions were done repeatedly and with intent to deceive, and impugned the reputation of her fellow physicians.\", \"action\": {\"misuse\": {\"vector\": [\"LAN access\"], \"variety\": [\"Privilege abuse\", \"Unapproved workaround\"]}}, \"security_incident\": \"Confirmed\", \"plus\": {\"github\": \"3116\", \"analysis_status\": \"First pass\", \"created\": \"2015-03-19T22:26:49Z\", \"attribute\": {\"confidentiality\": {\"credit_monitoring\": \"U\"}}, \"modified\": \"2015-03-19T22:26:49Z\", \"timeline\": {\"notification\": {\"month\": 3, \"year\": 2013}}, \"master_id\": \"96E598D6-AEB9-4CD1-A7B4-933DB95223DE\", \"analyst\": \"swidup\"}, \"asset\": {\"assets\": [{\"variety\": \"S - Database\"}]}, \"victim\": {\"country\": [\"CA\"], \"employee_count\": \"101 to 1000\", \"industry\": \"621111\", \"region\": [\"019021\"], \"victim_id\": \"Misericordia Hospital\"}, \"timeline\": {\"incident\": {\"year\": 2010}}, \"source_id\": \"vcdb\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"57a21d250be444284201f859\"}, \"schema_version\": \"1.3\"}",

Kardashian was among the patient whose records were accessed inappropriately at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles between June 18 and June 24. The Los Angeles Times reported that six workers were fired for the internal breach, but hopefully this case will help alert the public of ongoing health data security issues and spark conversation within the industry to reevaluate celebrity patient privacy procedures.  Kardashian gave birth on June 15 at Cedars-Sinai to North West (yes, thats her real name) and according to Reuters, the organization contacted her shortly after checking out of the hospital to alert her that her data had been breached. Exactly what patient information, such as medical or financial data, was viewed has yet to be reported.  Los Angeles healthcare organizations such as Cedars-Sinai often have to deal with high-profile patient records being targeted during internal breaches and this Cedars-Sinai case was no different, as five of the employees accessed a single patient record the other viewed 14 different records.  Cedars-Sinai said that three community physicians, Dr. Sam Bakshian, Dr. Abraham Ishaaya and Dr. Shamim Shakibai, violated hospital policy by offering their user names and passwords to employees, who then used the logins to access confidential patient records, including Kardashians. And according to a Cedars-Sinai statement, four of the six workers who logged onto the hospitals information system without permission to access patient records were local physicians employees that had hospital staff privileges. The others were a research assistant and volunteer.  David Blake, Cedars-Sinais chief privacy officer, said in a statement to the Times that the hospital has a high standard for security and that unauthorized access to any patients record is, quite simply, unacceptable.  Though theres a strong chance that employees werent trying to do much beyond look at the records in efforts to find Kardashians. But Cedars-Sinai was smart to act swiftly in firing all of the employees involved and banning them from accessing its patient data from another organization in the future. Healthcare organizations can only do so much to train employees and when they give out passwords to their underlings who arent supposed to have access, it makes their job to protect data even harder.  Other high-profile patient privacy breaches at Los Angeles healthcare organizations include data belonging to late actress Farrah Fawcett, Britney Spears and Maria Shriver being inappropriately accessed at UCLA Medical Center.\", \"action\": {\"misuse\": {\"vector\": [\"LAN access\"], \"variety\": [\"Privilege abuse\"]}}, \"security_incident\": \"Confirmed\", \"plus\": {\"github\": \"2523\", \"analysis_status\": \"First pass\", \"created\": \"2015-03-10T00:40:47Z\", \"attribute\": {\"confidentiality\": {\"credit_monitoring\": \"U\"}}, \"modified\": \"2015-03-10T00:40:47Z\", \"timeline\": {\"notification\": {\"month\": 7, \"day\": 15, \"year\": 2013}}, \"master_id\": \"DE78D048-8CB7-4A1A-907B-135A3CD82B58\", \"analyst\": \"swidup\"}, \"asset\": {\"assets\": [{\"variety\": \"S - Database\"}]}, \"victim\": {\"victim_id\": \"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center\", \"country\": [\"US\"], \"region\": [\"019021\"], \"state\": \"CA\", \"employee_count\": \"1001 to 10000\", \"industry\": \"622110\"}, \"timeline\": {\"incident\": {\"month\": 6, \"year\": 2013}}, \"source_id\": \"vcdb\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"57a21d260be444284201f8ba\"}, \"schema_version\": \"1.3\"}",

John Strain.  The investigation also uncovered from his home computer about 1.8 million Social Security numbers from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, where Kim had been employed as an auditor. Veterans Affairs' officials have said only 185,000 numbers are at risk because many were repeated in the file.  Tae Kim, 28, was booked at Orange County Jail and is being held in lieu of $1 million bail after being arrested at 5 p.m. Thursday at a car wash in Koreatown, police said.  On April 7, two Asian men identified as Kim and Justin Hong, purchased jewelry from Jewelry Exchange at 15732 Tustin Village Way using three skimmed cards belong to three different victims, one of whom was actor Marlon Wayans, Strain said.  Wayans is best known for his role in the now defunct WB series The Wayans Bros. and the Scary Movie film series.  Kim was on formal probation and a search was conducted at his Los Angeles residence June 14 where a computer was taken as evidence. After a search warrant was obtained, police found the Social Security numbers hidden in a computer file.  Kim had worked at the Veteran Affairs office since 2003 when he was a student at USC but quit in February of this year when he discovered a background check would be conducted.  The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs verified that Kim did not have permission to possess the Social Security numbers. Officials have notified several victims from Orange County, police said.  In May 2006, Social Security numbers for 26.5 million U.S. veterans were stolen in an apparent random burglary in Maryland from a Veterans Affairs employee's house after he took the laptop containing the information home without authorization.  Authorities from the Orange County District Attorney's Office, LAPD and U.S. Marshalls have been attempting to arrest Kim since August.  Kim is believed to be a member of Koreatown Gangsters, police said.

What happened? A former employee allegedly stole patient data and used it for fraudulent purposes, and is now the subject of a law enforcement investigation.  What was the response? WRCBSS is reviewing its internal policies and procedures, as well as its technology safeguards. All impacted individuals are being notified.  Details: WRCBSS was notified by law enforcement on May 13 of a breach of information related to its billing files. The former employee who is the subject of the investigation worked for WRCBSS in 2011 and 2012. HHS.gov lists the breach as having occurred from Nov. 28, 2011, to June 29, 2012.  Quote: Presently, we are unable to identify the specific patients whose personal health information was actually stolen nor do we know which of those patients whose information was stolen was also used for fraudulent activities, Robin Hasty, office administrator for WRCBSS, wrote in the notification to patients. We are therefore notifying all patients whose personal information was in our billing system at the time of the breach.

Jawbone claims Fitbit is \\\"systematically plundering\\\" proprietary data by hiring Fitbit staffers who allegedly stole confidential information prior to leaving their respective Jawbone jobs, according to the Times. The legal complaint, filed in California State Court, also says the eight-year-old company stole trade secrets and intellectual property.  The news comes not long after Fitbit filed for a $100 million IPO, as well as a report that says the fitness tracker maker may be losing its tight grip as the market leader given increased consumer demand for smartwatch devices. Argus Insights research claims the wearables maker is struggling and that its leadership in wearables is less than 50 percent, which is much less than its 68 percent ownership of the fitness band segment.   The alleged employee poaching and data theft has been going on since the start of the year, according to the Times report, which cites Jawbone's legal filing. Reportedly, Fitbit recruiters have reached out to nearly a third of Jawbone's workers. In addition, those hired on by Fitbit reportedly took Jawbone data, such as product information and business plans, on their way out the door.  The Times reports the court complaint includes details of actions by two employees who admit to taking confidential data from Jawbone's systems and that Fitbit's top human resources manager admitted her company was poaching workers. In its legal filing, Jawbone is asking for court action to stop the alleged poaching and financial damages relating to the alleged stolen data. \", \"action\": {\"misuse\": {\"vector\": [\"LAN access\"], \"variety\": [\"Unapproved software\", \"Privilege abuse\", \"Unapproved hardware\"]}}, \"security_incident\": \"Confirmed\", \"plus\": {\"github\": \"5886\", \"dbir_year\": 2016, \"created\": \"2016-02-07T22:38:00Z\", \"attribute\": {\"confidentiality\": {\"credit_monitoring\": \"U\"}}, \"modified\": \"2016-02-07T22:38:00Z\", \"timeline\": {\"notification\": {\"year\": 2015}}, \"analysis_status\": \"Finalized\", \"master_id\": \"E93009F1-C3F3-4390-9F07-6750378BDBF1\", \"analyst\": \"swidup\"}, \"asset\": {\"assets\": [{\"variety\": \"S - File\"}, {\"variety\": \"U - Laptop\"}, {\"variety\": \"M - Flash drive\"}, {\"variety\": \"S - Other\"}, {\"variety\": \"U - Desktop\"}, {\"variety\": \"M - Disk drive\"}, {\"variety\": \"M - Documents\"}], \"governance\": [\"Unknown\"]}, \"victim\": {\"victim_id\": \"Jawbone\", \"country\": [\"US\"], \"region\": [\"019021\"], \"state\": \"CA\", \"employee_count\": \"101 to 1000\", \"industry\": \"423910\"}, \"timeline\": {\"incident\": {\"year\": 2015}}, \"source_id\": \"vcdb\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"57a21d2a0be444284201f9b2\"}, \"schema_version\": \"1.3\"}",

We sincerely regret this situation occurred, said Peggy Kares, HIPAA Security Officer at University Urology, P.C.  Following the breach, University Urology spoke with the breaching employee, terminated their employment, revoked their access to protected health information (PHI), changed internal passwords and agreed with the competing organization that received the patient information to destroy it. The organization added that employees would be retrained on patient privacy best practices.  University Urology, P.C. is notifying by mail the patients impacted by this breach. While it appears that the information subject to the breach was to be used for patient solicitation and there is absolutely no indication that the information may be used for purposes of identity theft, patients may choose to monitor their credit card, bank, or other financial statements for signs of fraud and identity theft.

Therefore, we regret to inform you of an incident that resulted in the possible unauthorized disclosure of your protected health information (PHI), including such information as your name, medical record number, medical diagnosis, physician's name, and limited sensitive medical information. Although we have no evidence that your PHI was inappropriately used, we are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to inform you of this incident in writing. We also want to assist you by providing you with the steps that you can take to protect yourself from any harm that may result from this incident. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: By way of background, HHC has implemented an information governance and security program that, among other things, monitors and detects all email communications that contain PHI and other confidential information that are sent outside of HHC's information systems without proper authorization. The incident in question, which occurred on January 15, 2015, was discovered on March 31, 2015 when, in the course of HHC's monitoring of outgoing emails, we identified an email that contained PHI, including yours, which a Metropolitan employee improperly sent from his HHC email account to his personal email account. While there is no indication that the employee improperly used the information contained in the email, its transmission was unauthorized and certainly not condoned by Metropolitan. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident and advising you of the actions that we have taken and the ones that we recommend you consider taking to protect yourself from any possible adverse effects that could arise as a result of this incident. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE BREACH: Metropolitan has promptly taken a number of steps in response to this incident. First, we interviewed the responsible Metropolitan employee and examined his HHC email account to ensure that we identified all the sites to which the email and spreadsheets were sent. We also reviewed the employee's personal email account, and were present to ensure that the employee deleted the email and spreadsheets from his personal email account. Second, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity theft protection at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.\", \"action\": {\"misuse\": {\"vector\": [\"LAN access\"], \"variety\": [\"Email misuse\"]}}, \"security_incident\": \"Confirmed\", \"plus\": {\"github\": \"6025\", \"dbir_year\": 2016, \"created\": \"2016-02-07T03:37:00Z\", \"attribute\": {\"confidentiality\": {\"credit_monitoring_years\": 1, \"credit_monitoring\": \"Y\"}}, \"modified\": \"2016-02-07T03:37:00Z\", \"timeline\": {\"notification\": {\"month\": 3, \"day\": 31, \"year\": 2015}}, \"analysis_status\": \"Finalized\", \"master_id\": \"EFFC2F32-5BFD-4398-A6E3-9F3B152F9E64\", \"analyst\": \"swidup\"}, \"asset\": {\"assets\": [{\"variety\": \"S - Mail\"}], \"governance\": [\"Unknown\"]}, \"victim\": {\"victim_id\": \"Metropolitan Hospital Center\", \"country\": [\"US\"], \"region\": [\"019021\"], \"state\": \"NY\", \"employee_count\": \"Unknown\", \"industry\": \"622110\"}, \"timeline\": {\"incident\": {\"month\": 1, \"day\": 15, \"year\": 2015}, \"discovery\": {\"unit\": \"Months\", \"value\": 2}}, \"source_id\": \"vcdb\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"57a21d2c0be444284201fa4c\"}, \"schema_version\": \"1.3\"}",

If you find errors in your medical files, have them corrected immediately. The federal law lets patients correct medical records created only by the medical provider or insurer that now maintains your information.

Elizabeth Feng, 23, of Madison, was charged Thursday with 17 counts of identity theft, two counts of misdemeanor theft and two counts of unauthorized opening of mail in the scheme, which began to unravel on May 30 when her boyfriend tried to make a legitimate payment on some parking tickets at the Madison Police Department.  Police have issued a warrant for Feng, who was also a UW-Madison student at the time.  According to a criminal complaint filed Thursday, the boyfriend went to pay parking tickets after his car had been impounded, only to be told that he had to pay in cash because fraudulent payments had been made for tickets on his car in the past.  Police staff had found that the earlier citations were paid using the checking account information of people who lived in New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut and Mississippi, and that one of those people had contacted police about the fraud, the complaint states.  The man told police the earlier payments had been made by his girlfriend, Feng, the complaint states.  According to the complaint:   Contacted by police, Feng at first admitted to using a \\\"random person's account\\\" a couple of times, from information she found on a website. But pressed further, she admitted taking mail belonging to other people in her apartment building in the 400 block of West Dayton Street, not cashing personal checks sent to her neighbors but using account number and bank routing information on them to pay her boyfriend's parking tickets online.  Among the items taken from Feng's neighbors' mail were also packages of goods such as a wine opener, clothing and a cutting board and knife. Feng said she threw most of that stuff away. In her apartment, police found opened mail and boxes addressed to other people. Feng opened six credit card accounts using information for five patients stolen from the VA Hospital, where she worked. She had mail for the accounts addressed to the apartment of one of her neighbors, who told police he was shocked when informed that there were 16 credit cards in 14 names associated with his address. The man said that when he received mail that wasn't addressed to him, he would drop it on the floor by the mailboxes.  Police also found a large number of Capital One credit cards in Feng's apartment and found the names on them matched a list of 15 names and Social Security numbers that police found on a document located on Feng's computer.  Two of VA Hospital patients had since died. The son of one of those men told police that on the day of his father's funeral, his mother received a phone call from Capital One asking if his father had recently opened a credit card with them.  Feng had worked as a medical assistant in the hospital's pathology and lab department. She left her job on May 31. The hospital's lab manager told police that Feng would have had access to patient information including birth dates and Social Security numbers.\", \"action\": {\"misuse\": {\"vector\": [\"LAN access\"], \"variety\": [\"Privilege abuse\"]}}, \"security_incident\": \"Confirmed\", \"plus\": {\"github\": \"5550\", \"dbir_year\": 2016, \"created\": \"2016-02-09T02:26:00Z\", \"attribute\": {\"confidentiality\": {\"credit_monitoring\": \"U\", \"data_misuse\": \"Y\"}}, \"modified\": \"2016-02-09T02:26:00Z\", \"timeline\": {\"notification\": {\"month\": 3, \"year\": 2015}}, \"analysis_status\": \"Finalized\", \"master_id\": \"F59B48F9-B8CD-4F25-AF9E-179018157A07\", \"analyst\": \"swidup\"}, \"asset\": {\"assets\": [{\"variety\": \"S - Database\"}], \"governance\": [\"Unknown\"]}, \"victim\": {\"victim_id\": \"United States Veterans Administration\", \"country\": [\"US\"], \"region\": [\"019021\"], \"state\": \"DC\", \"employee_count\": \"Large\", \"industry\": \"923120\"}, \"timeline\": {\"incident\": {\"year\": 2015}}, \"source_id\": \"vcdb\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"57a21d2e0be444284201fab9\"}, \"schema_version\": \"1.3\"}",

But 2 NEWS Investigates uncovered a lawsuit by two local women that alleges they repeatedly had the privacy of their health information violated by employees at Kettering Health Network, also known as Kettering Adventist Healthcare.  Every time you see a new doctor you probably sign a notice of privacy practices. Its part of a national law called HIPAA.  Its meant to keep things like your visits to the doctor and even your billing information from getting into the wrong hands.  But Kettering Health Network and its former employee are being sued accused of not following that law.  Vicki Sheldon and her daughter Haley say they feel violated.  I dont know if I could feel anymore violated then if I had just been stripped down naked and walked in front of every executive in Kettering, said Vicki.  They claim Kettering Health Network employees wrongfully accessed their health information.  Vicki said Kettering first alerted her to the violation. According to Vicki, Kettering told her that her ex-husband, Duane Sheldon who worked in the Administration Department at Kettering, had inappropriately looked at her records.  I received some reports directly from Kettering, from their system. Quite frankly when I got them I was very disturbed by the number of people who had no reason to be in my records had been in my records apparently just whenever they felt like looking.  Vicki said that report showed her records were looked at again and again for 15 months by people who she says had nothing to do with her care.  Both women believe Kettering Health Network did not have the appropriate procedures in place to protect their private records.  Theyre suing both Kettering Health Network and Duane Sheldon for invasion of privacy and negligence.  Duane Sheldons attorney told me hes declining an interview but provided a brief statement that says in part, much of the Plaintiffs Complaint is inaccurate and personally inflammatory.  According to his attorney, Duane Sheldon no longer works for Kettering Health Network.  Kettering declined to comment directly about the lawsuit.  But regardless of the legal side of things, 2 NEWS Investigates wanted to know how safe your information really is and if there was in fact a breach at a health network that serves thousands of people in the Miami Valley.  The Director of Compliance Program, Megan Brickner who oversees patient protection agreed to answer questions.  Natalie: Was there a HIPAA violation at this network by employees?  Brickner: I cannot comment to that in particular, but I can say again we have this Protect program that we are continuously looking at the risk landscape and if we see something we need to address then we do so,  Brickner said not every employee has access to every part of a patients record. The access they get is based on their job title.  She also said Kettering has a system in place that notifies them if a patients record was accessed by the wrong person.  There are reports that get ran. We also have a third party come in every year looking at our IT infrastructure, she said.  Brickner wouldnt go into detail about the types of reports that are run or disclose the latest results of them.  But she does say if your records were looked at inappropriately its required by law to let you know.  Natalie: Should patients be worried about their medical information?  Brickner: To be honest with you, I think everyone needs to always be vigilant. I think its very important to be your own advocate.  Natalie: Are you running those reports and is everything working?  Brickner: Yes. Everything is working. I will tell you how well its working. We do have a commitment to protecting patient privacy and securing their information.  Vicki said those answers are not enough.  I would hate for anybody to have to go through this. Its humiliating. Its degrading. It takes away your power, said Vicki Sheldon.  According to public court documents Duane Sheldon and Kettering are asking that the lawsuit be dismissed, arguing that individuals cant sue over HIPAA violations.  2 NEWS Investigates went to the top legal expert in the state to find out.  My understanding of the law is that individuals do not have the right to sue under the HIPAA law but what they could do is file under a tort law of common law that exists in every state and file an action under that, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.  DeWine said a states attorney general and the US Department of Health and Human Services are the ones who can take legal action when someone believes their health information was violated.  Vicki and Haleys attorney said the government is overburdened and this case is about more than HIPAA violations. Its about an invasion of privacy.  Its a new and emerging area of the law therefore in Ohio, this type of breach doesnt have a lot of case law behind it, but there are other states notably Indiana and California where theres been significant privacy violations, said Vicki and Haleys attorney, Rob Croskery.  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, you have the right to see and get a copy of your health records and who has looked at them. All you need to do is ask your hospital for them. In most cases they have up to 30 days to provide the copy.\", \"action\": {\"misuse\": {\"vector\": [\"LAN access\"], \"variety\": [\"Privilege abuse\"]}}, \"security_incident\": \"Confirmed\", \"plus\": {\"github\": \"4168\", \"analysis_status\": \"First pass\", \"created\": \"2015-03-26T23:30:03Z\", \"attribute\": {\"confidentiality\": {\"credit_monitoring\": \"U\"}}, \"modified\": \"2015-03-26T23:30:03Z\", \"timeline\": {\"notification\": {\"year\": 2014}}, \"master_id\": \"F61D5071-1734-4277-BDC4-CE523F924BC8\", \"analyst\": \"swidup\"}, \"asset\": {\"assets\": [{\"variety\": \"S - Database\"}]}, \"victim\": {\"victim_id\": \"Kettering Health Network\", \"country\": [\"US\"], \"region\": [\"019021\"], \"state\": \"OH\", \"employee_count\": \"Unknown\", \"industry\": \"621999\"}, \"timeline\": {\"incident\": {\"year\": 2014}}, \"source_id\": \"vcdb\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"57a21d2e0be444284201fac3\"}, \"schema_version\": \"1.3\"}",

Dana J. Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; and Andrew G. McCabe, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBIs Washington Field Office, made the announcement after Ebrahimis initial appearance today in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson. If convicted, Ebrahimi faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each wire fraud count, 10 years in prison on each health care fraud count, a mandatory two-year consecutive sentence for each of the aggravated identity theft counts, and five years in prison on each count of making a false claim regarding health care matters. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Criminal indictments are only charges and not evidence of guilt. A defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty. According to allegations in the indictment, Ebrahimi, a law school graduate, owned and controlled Dental Arts Group, which purported to provide administrative and consulting services to dental practices. Through her control of Dental Arts Group, Ebrahimi allegedly carried out a scheme to steal the identities of various individuals, including other dentists, and use their identities without their knowledge to open merchant accounts with consumer dental financing programs, including CareCredit. To gain access to these programs, Ebrahimi submitted false and misleading enrollment applications. Once the fraudulent CareCredit merchant accounts were opened, Ebrahimi allegedly billed patients for charges that were inflated, never authorized, or never approved. For example, under one CareCredit merchant account that Ebrahimi opened without the victims knowledge, patients disputed nearly 50 percent of the total amount Ebrahimi charged for purported dental services. At the time, the dispute rate for all other CareCredit dental merchants was less than 1 percent. Furthermore, Ebrahimi allegedly submitted false CareCredit charge slips that purported to bear the signatures of patients. The indictment further alleges that Ebrahimi defrauded Humana, a private health insurer, by submitting false and inflated insurance claims for dental services that were never rendered. Ebrahimi allegedly deposited the profits earned from her scheme in various bank accounts that she controlled. Finally, the indictment alleges that Ebrahimi manufactured, or attempted to manufacture, and destroy various patient records. This case is being investigated by the FBIs Washington Field Office. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Lowell and Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye are prosecuting the case.

That failure to encrypt, combined with human error, resulted in a regrettable privacy breach.  On December 27, CMH discovered that materials with patients names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and certain medical diagnoses had been transmitted to AAMS on December 12. AAMS then used that information, in error, to send introductory letters to the patients and, in some cases, they sent them medical equipment.  When CMH discovered their error, they contacted AAMS, who destroyed their copy of the data, and agreed that no further letters would be sent out. Patients who received equipment from AAMS were asked to contact them to arrange for the return of the equipment at no cost to them.  Because CMH and AAMS are both covered by HIPAA, this breach was not as bad as it might have been, although clearly it was an unintended disclosure of PHI that patients needed to be informed about.  As part of preventing future incidents of this kind, CMH is undertaking a number of steps, including deploying encryption when emailing outside the company. Actually, they should have been doing that anyway, as even though they may trust the recipient, failure to encrypt allows capture or interception of the communications by attackers.

Now hes unemployed and telling all on reddit.  David Helkowski was working for Canton Group, a Baltimore-based software consulting firm on a project for the University of Maryland (UMD), when he claims he found malware on the universitys servers that could be used to gain access to personal data of students and faculty. But he says his employer and the university failed to take action on the report, and the vulnerability remained in place even after a data breach exposed more than 300,000 students and former students Social Security numbers.  As Helkowski said to a co-worker in Steam chat, I got tired of being ignored, so I forced their hand. He penetrated the universitys network from home, working over multiple VPNs, and downloaded the personal data of members of the universitys security task force. He then posted the data to Pastebin and e-mailed the members of the task force anonymously on March 15.  One day later, the FBI obtained a search warrant for Helkowskis home. While no charges have yet been filed against him, Helkowskis employment with Canton Group has ended. And yesterday, he took to reddit to tell everyone about it in a post entitled IamA Hacker who was Raided by the FBI and Secret Service AMAA! To prove his identity, he even posted a redacted copy of the search warrant he was served.  How did the FBI track him down so fast? It turns out that Helkowski told just about everyone (including co-workers) about what he was doing. And since the vulnerability he used was the same one Canton Group had reported to UMD on February 27, it didnt take a lot of sleuthing to follow a trail that pointed straight back to Helkowskis home in the Baltimore suburb of Parkville.  On the night of March 16, Helkowski and his wife arrived home to find the raid in progress.  There were 12 or so people. I wasn't home when they busted in my door. They actually busted in the side door. My dog was home. He ran out the doggie door then ran out the gate that they had opened. They let my dog run away basically.  I was driving up to my house, returning from dinner, and all the lights in my house were on, many cars parked out front, and cars in my driveway. I saw people walking around out front. I wondered why there was a party at my house.  As I slowed down to take a look, they yelled at me, pointed a gun (I saw one at least), and ordered me to stop the car and put my hands out the window. I did so. They then told me to use one hand to shut off the car and hold the key out the window as well. I did that. They took the key, and then demanded I get out of the car.  They then [put my hands] against the car and frisked me. They immediately took my cellphone from me, and then led me inside. Helkowski asked permission to call for his father to retrieve his dog while agents detained him and his wife. An agent called Helkowskis father, saying he was a friend and had noticed the dog was loose, Helkowski said. His father came to the scene to retrieve the dogand was then detained by federal agents. My dad of course had to accuse me in front of the FBI Are you gonna learn your lesson now and not do stuff like this? or something like that... in front of the FBI. Geez dad. Thanks.  Helkowski said that he cooperated fully with the agents. During the RAID I provided my 20+ character system encryption password, my Keepass password, the location of my keyfiles, and a full description of everything. I basically 'confessed' everything to the FBI already. My stance is that I did nothing 'morally wrong.' My attempt the entire time has been to help the university improve their security.  In a March 20 staff memo published by the University of Maryland from Ann G.
